The news that Pat would be exiting the show led many to realize that, in the show's almost 50-year history, it's only had a total of two hosts.</p><p>Following that revelation, many naturally wanted to learn more about <a href=#>Chuck Woolery, the show's first host</a>, including any details about exactly why Chuck left the show after a relatively short hosting stint.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Chuck Woolery leave 'Wheel of Fortune'?</h2><p>Chuck was the original host of Wheel of Fortune, both when it was first introduced during Shopper's Bazaar and again two years later in 1975 when it debuted as its own series. He was selected by Merv Griffin, the show's creator, as the host, and turned the gig down several times, in part because he believed that his ultimate calling was in country music.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Chuck ultimately signed on, though, and he hosted the show regularly until 1981. It was then that Chuck realized that Wheel of Fortune and other game shows like it were becoming genuinely popular, and asked Merv for a raise to $10,000 a week, up from the $5,000 that he had been making. This raise would have brought Chuck's salary in line with other game show hosts, or at least that's what Chuck argued.</p><p>Merv offered Chuck $7,500, and NBC agreed to pay the remaining $2,500 until Merv threatened to move the show over to CBS. NBC removed its offer, and Chuck decided to leave the show on Dec. 25, 1981, rather than work for $7,500 a week. Pat Sajak was brought in to host the show beginning on Dec. 28, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Chuck went on to host other game shows, but none of them were ultimately as popular or enduring as Wheel of Fortune ultimately became.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">In June 2023, Pat Sajak announced that he would retire in 2024.</h2><p>Though Pat didn't go into much detail about his reasons for leaving the show, the longtime host delivered the news to his fans on social media.</p><p style=text-align:start>"Well, the time has come. I’ve decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last," Pat wrote on Twitter. "It’s been a wonderful ride, and I’ll have more to say in the coming months.
