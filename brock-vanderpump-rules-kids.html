The show came together because of <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a>, who rose to fame on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Now, <a href=#>Brock Davies</a> is a huge part of Vanderpump Rules, known for his work in fitness and his sports careers in rugby and football. And on top of all that, he’s a dad.</p><p>But there has been some drama surrounding Brock's family life, especially when he first joined the hit <a href=#>Bravo</a> reality show. Here’s what you should know about Brock's kids from his previous marriage — and why he says he doesn't see them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@brock__davies</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Brock from ‘Vanderpump Rules’ has three kids.</h2><p>Brock and his wife, <a href=#>Scheana Shay</a>, welcomed their daughter into the world on April 26, 2021. They gave their daughter a super precious name: Summer Moon. After expanding their family together, they made the public announcement that they were engaged in July 2021. In August 2022, they got married.</p><p>But as most Vanderpump Rules fans know by now, this isn't Brock’s first venture into fatherhood. He actually has two other children who are still currently living in Australia with his ex-wife. With Brock and Scheana's relationship (mostly) thriving on the show, it seems like everything should be feeling pretty ideal. Unfortunately, Brock’s lack of communication with his first two children is far from that.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brock (@brock__davies)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why can't Brock see his kids?</h2><p>Brock explained in a Vanderpump Rules episode in 2021 that, at that time, it had been about four years since he had any contact with his first two children. He said he hadn't even spoken with them via FaceTime. He revealed that he was 20 years old when he became a father for the first time and a “different person." He described a difficult breakup with his ex, leading us to believe there was likely a lot of animosity between them. He explained, “She cut my whole family out.”</p><p>He went on to say, “Me and my ex, we had two beautiful kids. We split up, and she felt like I abandoned her and the kids by coming to America. She moved on with the kids’ stepdad, who then fulfilled the role of being a dad for my kids.” Not having any contact with his first two kids has definitely taken a toll on Brock.</p><p>And when Katie Maloney pressed the issue continuously on the show at the time, it brought up old wounds.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@brock__davies</a></figure><p>He further explained, “I felt like I did abandon them. And I felt like I needed to accept it because I was the one who moved to America. You know, I moved over here."</p><p>Scheana chimed in to add, “It sounds bad but there’s a lot more to it. No contact, but it’s not for lack of trying. He moved to America to provide a better life for his family." His reasons for moving might've been valid, but the ending result is still heartbreaking.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brock (@brock)</a></p></figure><p>In January 2024, Brock shared on Scheana's podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scheananigans</a> that he hadn't seen his older two kids yet at that time, but he is still working on proving himself to his ex and her husband, his kids' step-father.</p><p>"I need to show them, keep turning up and show them that I am the dad that I want to be and that they want to be around," he said. "So that’s first and foremost... We’re working on a healthier relationship, or a better relationship, with the kids' mom and their step-dad. And the goal is to just be on time with my child support every month, make sure that payment goes across, and just continually turns up."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brock (@brock)</a></p></figure><p>Brock also shared details during part one of the Season 11 Vanderpump Rules reunion on May 14, 2024. He told host Andy Cohen that he and Scheana had traveled to Australia, but he wasn't able to see his kids. According to him, he and his ex-wife are leaving it up to their children to decide when they're ready to welcome Brock into their lives.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Brock planning to have more kids?</h2><p>The devastating situation Brock’s in with his first two kids is unfortunate, but does he still plan to expand his family in the future with Scheana? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, they’ve had conversations about having more kids through surrogacy or adoption.</p><p>Scheana isn’t too interested in carrying out another pregnancy since her first pregnancy was filled with complications. If they do choose to pursue a second child, it may be through alternative options.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bwr8pmrZqmlJq%2FscHMqWSrrZyawG63yJ2q</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./father-of-the-bride-2022-filming-locations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Father of the Bride' 2022 Filming Locations: What to Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-collins-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kris Collins - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
