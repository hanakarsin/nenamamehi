Although the rapper's "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Safaera</a>" has been around and available for purchase and streaming since Feb. 28, 2020, fans couldn't help but notice that the listing suddenly was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">removed from Spotify</a>. And to say that they were disappointed is a pretty big understatement.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans are pretty furious with Spotify for removing Bad Bunny's "Safaera".</h2><p>Bad Bunny fans came out in droves to tell Spotify that they really need to get the song back on the platform ASAP. The backlash was to the point that many users were threatening to leave the app altogether in favor of another music streaming service, like Apple Music, which does, as of now, still contain the hit song.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Other fans announced their intention to buy the song on iTunes, since it's difficult to know if streaming platforms will always have the rights to the song. Which brings us to a very important question in regards to the song's removal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why was "Safaera" removed in the first place?</h2><p>One rumor spread across the internet that the song was removed because it was too explicit. The rumor got so powerful that posts were made on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify's Community page</a> condemning them for removing explicit content ‚Äî especially considering that in this case they'd have removed one very explicit song despite having thousands of others on their platform.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So you mean to tell me <a href=#>@Spotify</a> removed Safaera because it‚Äôs too ‚Äúexplicit‚Äù üòê yeah I‚Äôm canceling my Spotify Premium if they don‚Äôt put it back üò§ <a href=#>@SpotifyCares</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/x2xDVNaELy</a></p>‚Äî jen üß† (@jxaclop) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></figure><p>Which is why this theory doesn't really seem likely. In fact, Spotify is pretty clear on that it's up to the user to determine whether something is too explicit for them, not up to Spotify. On their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Support page</a>, they acknowledge that their app contains explicit content and that they mark it as such, based on information they receive from the person who holds the rights to the song.</p><p>In fact, they detail a way you can block explicit content on your own account, but they make no mention of they themselves removing content that's "too explicit".</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me: 2020 can‚Äôt get any worst...</p><p>Spotify *takes off safaera* <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mKcDHeztpB</a></p>‚Äî Cassandra J. marin (@Slayedby_Cas) <a href=#>May 14, 2020</a></figure><p>Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@kittycoello</a> seemed to have gotten to the bottom of the real reason the song was removed. She tweeted a conversation she claims to have had with a Spotify support representative. According to the post, the representative claimed that "there are some permission issues with the rights holders of that song. It might be grayed out now but it might reappear in soon. We're just waiting for any progress between the record label and the artist."</p><p>The theory that it's a rights issue holds a lot more water than it being too explicit. Artists themselves can request to have their music taken down, as can a record label. Disputes between Spotify and record labels or artists honestly happen pretty often. It's not too uncommon to open up the app and discover a song has gone missing. It's also not uncommon for the song to pop back in later on. Remember when Taylor Swift took down <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her entire music collection on Spotify</a>?</p><p>As of now, neither Bad Bunny or Spotify have publicly commented on the removal of "Safaera".</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey there! We‚Äôd love to have Safaera available on Spotify - and hopefully one day we will. There's more info about Spotify content here: <a href=#>https://t.co/N3Jf4gdGnJ</a>.

We add new content&nbsp;to Spotify every day, so if you can‚Äôt find something you‚Äôre looking for right now, it may appear (or reappear) soon."&nbsp;</p><p>This seems to suggest that it is indeed a rights issue, not an explicit content issue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6nrcSrmGaroKTBqrLYZqmepZ%2BrsqU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boko-haram-bandits-our-military-is-overwhelmed-ndume.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boko Haram/Bandits: Our Military Is Overwhelmed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./obasa-receives-lagos-cp-odumosu-says-lagosians-must-be-treated-with-respect-dignity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Obasa Receives Lagos CP Odumosu, Says Lagosians Must Be Treated With Respect, Dignity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
