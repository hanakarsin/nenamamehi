This company can provide services or manufacture goods, as well as exchange products for money. The person who owns the business is an entrepreneur and is sometimes referred to as the CEO of the company. Some people believe that any person who owns a business only reaps the benefits himself/herself. This is not so. Entrepreneurship is more than just owning a business.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5eh2db3s1fq.jpeg><p class=align-left>A developing country needs a lot of entrepreneurs who are willing to take a risk and find new opportunities. In order to fight poverty and low-income, every developing country encourages its citizens to start a business.

Young businessmen and women would not only create new job vacancies, but also inspire other people to start their own business. So, if there is a shortage of private enterprises, it is less likely for the people to have a place to work and earn a living.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt282j0i32je0g.jpeg><p class=align-left>With small business, you do not need to worry about finding a large capital to get started. It can be set up almost anywhere in the country. Youth might even choose to build their businesses in rural areas which will end up reducing the rate of people migrating to urban areas just to get a job. This will lead to a de-congestion of the big cities and also the development of the rural areas.</p><h3>Social change</h3><p class=align-left>Every positive and successful businessman will set the best example for locals to strive for a better life. They want to improve their own living conditions and this will lead to a change in habits and a social change in general. People in developing countries often have a negative attitude to change but young business owners will set the right example. They break stereotypes and bring technology to people’s life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6137a6cf60528e98.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Challenges of entrepreneurship in Nigeria and potential solutions</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkytdh6olvth9e6.jpeg><p class=align-left>Business owners who study abroad often return to promote such ideals as recycling and safe environments programmes. Some successful ones launch educational, and scholarship funds to help individuals who need it and help the country develop as a whole.</p><h3>Capital development and innovations</h3><p class=align-left>Typically, the funds which entrepreneurs use to launch their business or expand it is a combination of their own money and loans from the bank. Entrepreneurs mobilize otherwise stagnant funds which is essential for the financial development for any country. This helps to improve the economic situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt6hujavl878f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Business owners often strive to bring more innovations into their business to achieve better results. The CEOs of companies constantly look for new ways to earn money and cooperate with international companies. Because of their ambition, entrepreneurs keep on investing in top existing technologies. They are open to any innovations and are not afraid to expand and integrate new technologies. This makes them capable of competing in international markets.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt6548sekvahf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 social issues Nigeria has to deal with right now</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Due to this, a developing country’s economy keeps on getting stronger and receiving the respect and trust of the local population as well as those in other countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6137a6cf60528e98.jpeg><p class=align-left>Young businessmen and businesswomen are the key to creating important changes in the economic growth of a developing country.
