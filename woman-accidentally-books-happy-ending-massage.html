Whether you're watching a sitcom, checking out a movie, or yakking it up with your friends over some food and drinks, everyone loves a classic mix-up, especially when it involves a bit of embarrassment. Which is exactly what happened to TikToker Maggie McGaugh, who posts under the handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@maggiemccaugh</a> on the popular social media platform.</p><p>"Today I went to get a massage, not knowing I was going to a 'happy endings' massage. Let's talk about it. First off, I booked it at 9 p.m. They answered the phone at 9 p.m., which should've been a red flag, but I continued. I pull up, it doesn't look great but, hey, whatever. So I walk in. There are no doors, only curtains, which I'm a little nervous about."</p><p>Despite several red flags, she proceeded... with caution. "I definitely got hidden video camera vibes, so I even looked around for cameras and proceeded with the massage," she said. "Now if you've ever gotten a massage you know they always tell you to get undressed to your comfort level," she continued. "So I always leave my underwear on."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@maggiemcgaugh href=#>@maggiemcgaugh</a><p>I went from üíÜüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è to üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è so fast</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Maggie McGaugh" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Maggie McGaugh</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>But when the masseuse enters the room, Maggie says she "really quickly rips my underwear down to my knees, and I was like 'what's happening?' Very uncomfortable. But to make matters worse she folds back the sheet that's already very small, so I'm completely exposed...booty up."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>Like many people who suddenly find themselves in uncomfortable situations, Maggie had no idea what to do: "I freeze in this instance, I'm not gonna lie. I am absolutely confused, like I don't want to be rude if this is normal."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>Things only escalated from there. "She then sits on my thighs. I reach down and pull my underwear back up and I was like, 'no, thank you, umm, I'm, just, just my shoulders please.' The poor woman was very confused as to why I was not into this. The massage was great once we established our boundaries."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>She concluded her story by saying, "I will say that I did not know you could search the internet for a list of these places to avoid them, because I will say the happy ending for me was leaving and the not so happy ending was realizing that they were on that website and that I had indeed booked myself a happy ending massage."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>So basically, with a little more research, Maggie would have learned it was that kind of massage parlor. The masseuse was only giving Maggie what she thought she ordered.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>Some TikTokers found it hard to believe anyone would accidentally book themselves a massage of this nature, but according to one user's response to Maggie's clip, it's understandable how this mix up could happen.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>They asked: "Was it by chance called 'classic massage'" to which Maggie replied, "there are like a billion places HOW did you guess this???"</p><p>As it turns out, the other TikTok user had a personal connection to this place through her ex. "My ex-husband was a frequent flyer there since we lived across the street. Went there once & felt so violated. I can see why they know him by name."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @maggiemcgaugh</span></figure><p>Maggie clarified in the comments section that, although she called the establishment at 9 p.m., her appointment time was actually for 10 a.m. the next day. Talk about a rude awakening.</p><p>How would have you reacted?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmJybmZmyr8DApaOyZZKkvKy%2FjKGYqaipYrKvsMinnmalkajAorPE</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yvonne-nelson-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yvonne Nelson - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marija-meglaj-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Marija Meglaj - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
