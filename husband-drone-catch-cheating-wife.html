"There's the guy, f--king a--hole, that my wife is cheating on me with. My wife of 18 years," he says. "And if you watch carefully, you're going to be able to see 18 years go right down the f--king drain."</p><p>"We had a good marriage," YAOG emotionally continues. "I thought we had a good marriage. Apparently not."</p><p>That's one way to catch them. Some commenters were quick to offer up suggestions on how he should confront her about the footage...</p>One commenter said: "You should change the locks and when she comes home and tries to get in, fly a drone down with divorce papers.""Future case study for divorce lawyers right here," another commenter wrote. "Use of drone footage to prove infidelity."<p>A third person offered a more violent solution: "Attach a bomb to the drone﻿."</p><p>Others wrote words of encouragement. "Dude your way to good for her you deserve way way better," one commenter said. Another added, "I don't know who you are or what you do for a living and I honestly don't care but here's the thing man... There is nothing you can do to change the past but you can do something about right now. Be the best you can be. Stay calm and be AWESOME! Peace out bro!﻿"</p><p>Technology really is an amazing thing, isn't it?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More from Distractify&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#><u>26 Dating Red Flags That’ll Make You Cringe</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>18 Losers to Bring Home If You Want Your Whole Family to Hate You</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>This Woman Invited Her Ex-Boyfriend to Her Wedding — And He RSVPed With an Amazing Song Request&nbsp;</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWt8cn2OamxogaJqvHJ7x66qm5memXqlvs6nnGabkamwqXnCoZyarJmjtG7DyJ%2Bc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-matawalle-officially-dumps-pdp-joins-apc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Matawalle Officially Dumps PDP, Joins APC</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1426412-abduljabbar-sheikh-maqary-ya-yi-karin-haske-bayan-wasu-kalamansa-sun-tada-kura-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Abduljabbar: Sheikh Maqary ya yi karin haske bayan wasu kalamansa sun tada kura</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
