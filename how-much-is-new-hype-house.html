The group of TikTok stars who banded together in a collective of their own in late 2019 has seen a rough few months since their start. Between original member Daisy Keech leaving (and bad-mouthing the group’s founders on her way out) and the <a href=#>lawsuits</a> the group has had, rumors of their disbandment quickly flew.</p><p>But it looks like the Hype House isn’t over just yet — in fact, the group has officially moved to a new house. But <a href=#>how much is the new Hype House worth?</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Hype House members moved into the former Clout House.</h2><p>Thomas Petrou and the group revealed the new Hype House in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> posted to Thomas’ channel, and fans instantly recognized the infamous house as the former Clout House.</p><p>For those who aren’t familiar with the different collectives of internet collab houses, the Clout House was formerly used by FaZe Banks and his group. The house was infamous for its parties and other shenanigans, and all of the group's members made videos in the house together.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Before the FaZe Clan moved into the house, YouTubers RiceGum and Sommer Ray were also residents at the address, making it well-recognized in the YouTube community.</p><p>This house is definitely an upgrade from their former house. A listing for the property on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Zillow</u></a> estimates the house is worth almost $9 million, and has 10 bedrooms across the 12,500 square feet.</p><p>Given that the house has some, ahem, clout of its own, fans were quick to comment that it might not have been a good idea for the group to pick that location, considering the address of the Clout House was so well-known.</p><p>“So moving into another house without a gate this time and people already know the address,” one user commented on Thomas’ video. “Not a smart idea, Thomas.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>“This really wasn’t the best idea for all of them especially since practically EVERYONE knows where that’s at,” another said.</p><p>It’s unclear why exactly the group decided to pick such a well-known house, though it’s possible the place’s size had something to do with it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did the Hype House move?</h2><p>Considering the house started only a few months ago, it’s surprising that the group made the decision to move locations so soon. As the Hype House members didn’t seem to be collecting complaints from neighbors (unlike some other collab houses are known for doing), fans were quick to wonder about the motive for the group’s move.</p><p>According to the drama Instagram account @tiktokroom, the group made the decision to move because they’re considering expanding soon.</p><p>"Needed more space and something new," Ryland Storms replied in a comment asking why they were moving. He then went on to tease the expansion, commenting "there might be a few more new members coming soon too."</p><p>Despite the departure of Daisy and Charli and Dixie D’Amelio, it’s clear that the Hype House has no plans to quit any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFlmah6r7HWZp%2ByqJVitbDB0p4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-deuce-real-life-twins.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>In Case You're Wondering, the Twins James Franco Plays on 'The Deuce' Are Real People</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-security-agencies-uncover-ipobs-plot-to-attack-kuje-prison-free-nnamdi-kanu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Security Agencies Uncover IPOB's Plot To Attack Kuje Prison, Free Nnamdi Kanu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
