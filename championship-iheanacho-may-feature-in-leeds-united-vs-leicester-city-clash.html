He is in the squad, but we will make the right decision for the next game,” Maresca said during a pre-match interview.</p><p>The encounter at Elland Road will witness the convergence of the top two teams in the Sky Bet Championship.</p><p>Leicester City presently holds a commanding lead of nine points at the pinnacle.</p><p>Meanwhile, retired France international <strong>Theirry Henry</strong> has urged Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen not to join his former club, Arsenal.</p><p>Victor Osimhen is currently one of the most wanted strikers in the world, and the fact his current club, Napoli, has agreed to sell him this summer has given room to more speculations about his future.</p><p>Recall that Osimhen made his name in European football last season when he scored 26 goals and provided five assists in 32 league games. This performance helped Napoli to win the Scudetto and also earned him the best striker in the league award alongside the league’s highest goalscorer award.</p><p>Aside from that, Osimhen was named the CAF player of the year and also finished eighth in the 2023 Ballon d’Or ranking.</p><p>Despite these feats, Theirry Henry has urged him not to move to Arsenal, which is one of the clubs reportedly considering making a move for his signature in the forthcoming summer.</p><p>Henry, who stated this after Osimhen scored against FC Barcelona in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first-leg clash with Napoli, which ended in a 1-1 draw, noted that he is looking forward to seeing what Osimhen can do in the Premier League.</p><p>“I’d like to see him now, what he can do in the Premier League or wherever he’s going or Paris Saint-Germain. Not Arsenal, I won’t go there,” Theirry Henry said on the UEFA Champions League show with CBS Sports Golazo.</p><p>“I want to see him take the next step and be more consistent with his output, but to be able to win the title with Napoli the way he did will stay in history forever, so all the best to him in his career.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FsZpygkaK9qrvNrJ%2BiqF2etaatzZqaoaddoq66ecWemK2topp6qrqMpZyenKNiwq%2B1056bZq6jYrmmtcKeqq2domKwqsDYZpqlmaOdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./693936-exclusive-prophet-told-mount-zion-ministries-pastors-wife-reveals-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Prophet Told Me About Mount Zion- Gloria Bamiloye</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-nene-leakes-father.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nene Leakes' Family History Is a Bit Complicated</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
