Mai Mala Buni as a sitting Governor to run the affairs of the APC as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee.</p><p>“He contends that this is against Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution which states that a sitting governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.</p><p>“In other words, had Buni been joined in the suit, the story may have been different today as we would have lost Ondo State to the PDP.</p><p>“Therefore, any other person affected by the actions of the Buni-led Committee will henceforth not fail to join him in any subsequent case in court.</p><p>“These includes any subsequent election matter in any part of this country and all the APC Congresses that are about to hold. The Supreme Court has just weaponised all those that would be aggrieved by the APC Congresses to proceed to court to challenge the competence of the Buni-led CECPC to organise the congresses and National Convention.</p><p>“The judiciary will subsequently destroy the entire structure of the Party from bottom to top.”</p><p>Keyamo pointed out that the Supreme Court has just given the APC a useful hint to save the ruling just before the beginning of its Congresses.</p><p>According to him, the planned congresses across the country slated for this weekend must immediately be suspended because it will be an exercise in futility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FyZqytoKeyrrGMnKauqqRirrGvjKKep6eimsBut8SymKanXZy8pr%2BMmp%2BemZRixKrAx2aaqKaXp7K0v8SsZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tori-bowie-cause-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Olympian Tori Bowie Tragically Passed Away at Just 32 Years Old</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./6-days-before-handing-over-buhari-approves-massive-shake-up-in-ministry-of-aviation-agencies-full-list.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>6 Days Before Handing Over, Buhari Approves Massive Shake Up In Ministry Of Aviation Agencies (Full</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
