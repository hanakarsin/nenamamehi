Ifedayo Sunday Abegunde, the Secretary to the State Government of Ondo State hereby tender my letter of resignation.”</p><p>“I want to thank Mr Governor for giving me the opportunity to serve the Government and people of Ondo State.”</p><p>“Again, my family and I wish Mr Governor quick recovery.”</p><p>He further stated that he was part of the party chieftains who helped Akeredolu during the 2016 governorship election in Ondo State.</p><p>He said, “I suffered in his (Akeredolu) administration because he didn’t release any fund for my office grants. He has been telling lies that he was giving me N5m every month even when he knew he didn’t give me such money.”</p><p>“Where on Earth did the governor give me such funds? Recently, I reported him to Governor Fayemi of Ekiti State and he promised to invite both of us to Abuja for settlement. I remember that I told Fayemi that I was going to spit on the face of Akeredolu if he repeated the lie that he was giving me N5m monthly if we meet face to face, and I would then return to Akure to resign and as well Inform the public of his looting sprees.”</p><p>“Akeredolu didn’t win the election in 2016 but we made it possible for him to become governor. We were the pillars behind him and we will not support him again. He will lose this time around.”</p><p>According to Abegunde, he can’t serve under the government of Akeredolu again because he makes his subjects pass through hardship.</p><p>“The Akeredolu’s administration is making the entire people of the state suffer and I cannot be part of that any longer. Everyone is suffering. He doesn’t pay salaries at the right time. As a matter of fact, Akeredolu has not performed to the expectations of the masses apart from the roads he is rehabilitating.”</p><p>“Akeredolu has turned Former Governor Mimiko to a saint with his own abysmal performance. We now see that Mimiko did well as governor because he gave his people enough funds to operate. I had worked with three governor’s, and I can say that in the history of Ondo State, Akeredolu is the worst governor,” Abegunde said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH14e49vZpqjlaeypbvLrmSdoZSjwW7DyKdkraCVYn9xfZVmnqiulae7sL7SoaCpZZWhsqTAyKilZp2oYsC0s44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./313248-kibra-residents-pick-ken-okoths-replacement-november-7-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kibra residents to pick Ken Okoth's replacement on November 7</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-2024-fa-cup-semi-finals-draw-in-full-chelsea-get-toughest-tie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>2023-2024 FA Cup Semi-Finals Draw In Full, Chelsea Get Toughest Tie</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
