Her first job was with WBOC-TV in Salisbury and Dover in 2006, just months after her graduation. She then moved to WFSB-TV in Connecticut as a journalist. In 2008, she went to work for the Hearst Corporation in Washington, DC, as a political commentator.</p><p class=align-left>In 2014, Hallie Jackson was hired by NBC News, and she covered the campaign of Ted Cruz (II) for the Republican presidential nomination. After the end of that campaign period, she was promoted to anchor the news show "MSNBC Live" (1996).</p><p class=align-left>In 2017 she was named MSNBC's Chief White House Correspondent.

He later pursued a career as a baseball coach. They dated for about four years, and after settling in their different vocations, they took the relationship to the next level.</p><p class=align-left>Hallie Jackson and Doug Hitchner got engaged in 2010 with minimal publicity. About a year later, Jackson got hitched to her college sweetheart sometime in 2011. The two exchanged vows in Hallie's home state at Perkasie, Pennysylvania, Bucks County.</p><p class=align-left>The intimate ceremony was graced by the couple's close friends and <a href=#>family</a> members. Doug is also a private guy, and his affiliation with the journalist put him in the limelight, with many simply knowing him as ''Hallie's husband.''</p><h3>Is Hallie Jackson still married?</h3><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, the pair went separate ways after about three years. They got divorced in 2014, and the circumstances leading to their divorce have remained unclear. Neither Doug nor Hallie have issued a public statement about the termination of the marriage. They had no children together. Doug Hitchner's whereabouts have also remained unknown since then.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Hallie Jackson?</h2><p class=align-left>The renowned journalist has always preferred to keep a low-key profile. Her dating sprees have not been known publicly, which has led to much curiosity from her followers and viewers.</p><p class=align-left>However, the TV queen has moved on from her failed marriage. She is now seeing fellow journalist Frank Thorp, who is NBC's Capitol Hill producer and anchor.</p><p class=align-left>Frank is a graduate of West Virginia University and has worked with several media outlets before settling with NBC. The big question which many readers may ask, ''Is Hallie Jackson married to Frank Thorp?''</p><p class=align-left>The two media personalities had kept their relationship under wraps until recently. It is no doubt that they met at work and are enjoying a happy relationship. Hallie Jackson and Frank Thorp are not married, but they recently welcomed their firstborn daughter to this <a href=#>world</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The little angel was born in March 2020, arriving three and a half weeks before her due date.

The statements claim that Hallie Jackson's daughters have been kept away from social media and their birthplaces and whereabouts remain unknown.</p><p class=align-left>The validity of these stories has not been ascertained because the daughter she shared with Frank was her firstborn.
