Is she or Tom going to respond to the cheating scandal anytime soon? Here is what we know so far.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Did Ariana Madix delete her Instagram because Tom Sandoval was caught cheating?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Ariana suddenly deleting her social media is no coincidence. On Friday, March 3, 2023, it was confirmed by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Us Weekly </a>that her boyfriend and co-star Tom was caught cheating, ending their almost 10-year relationship.</p><p>Not only is it reported that Tom was cheating, but he cheated with their mutual co-star <a href=#>Raquel Leviss</a>. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, the affair has been going on for six months. Raquel and Tom's social medias are still active and neither have posted a public statement addressing the rumor at time of writing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ariana and Tom seemed happy before the cheating rumors.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Before the cheating scandal, Ariana and Tom seemed to be as close as ever before. In a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour</a> the reality star gushed about her boyfriend and said that, "Once we got over being competitive, we realized we have huge strengths that we need to embrace. Where he leaves off, I pick up, and he picks up where I leave off. And that's good.”</p><p>The two even released a cookbook together, Fancy AF Cocktails: Drink Recipes from a Couple of Professional Drinkers back in 2019.</p><p>In fact, the topic of the reality couple moving a step forward in their relationship and having children has come up several times.</p><p>During the Season 9 reunion of the show Tom <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke up</a> and said, “Look, at a certain point, the idea of possibly having a kid, like, I’m into that. I think where we butted heads before was when Ariana said never, and I don’t want to be told never.”</p><p>Ariana went on to say about freezing her eggs, “I did it because they’re there. Why not get them out, why not get them frozen? If I die, they all go to Tom.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Fellow 'Vanderpump Rules' cast members have reacted to the scandal.</h2><p>The Tom cheating scandal has been making national headlines and has caused social media frenzies since the minute it was released.
