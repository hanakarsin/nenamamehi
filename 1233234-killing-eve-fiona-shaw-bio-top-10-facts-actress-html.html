Still, her truly Irish nature has made her brave and adventurous enough to start an acting career. Even though her appearance is far from the canonic beauty of Hollywood stars, she has always had a particular charm and enough courage to give no attention to what people think about her.</p><h3>This woman once pretended to be a king</h3><p class=align-left>It happened in 1995 when the star was cast to play Richard II in National's Cottesloe Theatre, London. This play directed by Deborah Warner was something incredible and controversial. A king played by a woman? The 1990s were not yet the time when people speak about the third gender freely or legalise same-gender relationships. Still, it was simply a new look at the Shakespearian tragedy, and Fiona coped with it marvellously.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b431c93acbf89c7d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Dylan Meyer?

Did Ms Shaw ever mind turning heads and having all eyes on her? It seems, no. Anyway, the play will remain in history as something unexpected and absolutely brilliant.</p><h3>She possesses one of the highest awards</h3><p class=align-left>In 2001, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ms Shaw was awarded</a> one of the highest remarks a person in the United Kingdom can expect. She is now called Dame Commander and possesses the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. What is it? It is an old British chivalry title given to the ones who have outstanding achievements in the field of social or public services, science, art, or charity.</p><p class=align-left>The list of holders of this order is quite long and involves other honoured people who have glorified Great Britain with their work. Among them, there are such stars as Elton John, Rowan Atkinson, Eric Clapton, and others.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/29c240e392b78e7f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The exciting biography of famous comedy TV star Nicole Sullivan</span></p></a><h3>Fiona is ridiculously intelligent</h3><p class=align-left>It is visible from her very appearance that Ms Show definitely possesses a smart and witty brain. She has proof of her academic successes and true excellence. It comes in the form of an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">academic degree</a> given to her by the National University of Ireland (namely, the famous Trinity College in Dublin) in 1997. Since 2001, she has been the Honorary Professor of Drama, able to teach students her exceptional skills.</p><h3>Fiona Shaw lesbian views are no longer a secret</h3><p class=align-left>Ms Shaw has been openly homosexual to every fan who keeps an eye on her life and career since the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship with Saffron Burrows</a>. The two actresses were together around the 2000s: Saffron opened the truth in an interview in 1999. The Saffron Burrows Fiona Shaw romance did not last for a long time, and they separated. Later, Saffron who has always considered herself bisexual started a new relationship with a woman and consequently got married to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/29ac6d21422db390.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fascinating facts about the talented Linda Hunt</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since then, the woman was allegedly single until she met Dr Sonali Deraniyagala.

The actress speaks about her current relationship as a marriage that is supposed to put an end to all the rumours and empty talks about her personal life. She says that she has finally found a quiet moment of happiness she has never had before due to her work. Hopefully, the current Fiona Shaw partner will also have her soul healed after the horrible loss.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b17380b27a88ee69.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The detailed life story of Michelle Mylett: Her career, net worth and personal life</span></p></a><h3>The actress has turned into a director</h3><p class=align-left>Many actors and actresses have tried their hand at directing, and many have become successful directors of movies. However, the woman has taken a big step forth and moved to directing operas. It is incredible how much talent she has and how versatile it is. Ms Show is sure that operas are more interesting than regular stage performances. No wonder that she does so well, then. Her opera directing experience includes such great plays as The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Marriage of Figaro</a>, one of the most prominent classical operas ever.</p><h3>Fiona likes working to failure</h3><p class=align-left>A list of 74 roles in movies is quite impressive. There are bigger ones, some people may say. However, it is necessary to remember that screen appearances have not been the actress’s primary occupation over many years. She used to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">combine performing</a> on film sets at daytime with working hard in theatre at night. This is how it was so hard to be Fiona Shaw girlfriend at the moments of the highest workload she used to undertake.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/12faaf6265137170.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about the stunning American actress Kat Dennings</span></p></a><h3>This lady has always been a tomboy</h3><p class=align-left>Irish women are raised in very <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">precise traditions</a>. Most of them are family and childbirth oriented. The Catholic beliefs they are taught often influence the way they live. In the case with this marvellous actress, it was not so. She has practically always looked like a tomboy with mostly short hairstyles.</p><p class=align-left>However, it has not influenced her skill to behave in an utterly feminine way when necessary in her life or for her role. Ms Shaw is a true classical stage actress who can play any part and wear any personality, which is confirmed by her cooperation with the Royal National Theatre and many other classical theatres.</p><h3>She has a good collection of awards</h3><p class=align-left>Within her career, Ms Shaw has collected a good set of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">awards and nominations</a>. The first nomination for Olivier Award came in 1986 for “As You Like It” supporting role. Ms Shaw did not win it then but received it four years later, in 1990, as the best actress in “Electra". In 1992, she was nominated again but did not win for the role of Hedda Gabler. Her work in “Machinal” was nominated (and won) twice for Evening Standard Award and Olivier Award – both as the best actress. “The Waste Land” brought her Drama Desk Award in 1997 for her outstanding solo performance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/58f7afa388b1ffd3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find out top facts from the biography of Gabrielle Union</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The 2000s were rich with nominations. Fiona’s work in “Medea” was nominated three times: Evening Standard Award in 2001 (best actress; won), Drama Desk Award in 2003 (outstanding actress; nomination only), and Tony Award (best actress; nomination only). “Happy Days” brought two nominations: Olivier Award for the best actress and Drama Desk Award for outstanding acting. In 2017, “Channel Zero” brought her a nomination as the best supporting actress from Fangoria Chainsaw Awards.</p><h3>The actress is said to be a millionaire</h3><p class=align-left>Net worth is one of the most interesting topics when we speak about movie stars and other celebrities. Ms Shaw <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is said to possess</a> about $5 million. Her appearance in the series of films about Harry Potter has replenished her bank accounts significantly. There is no need to mention TV series like “True Blood” or “Killing Eve” that have become very popular with the audience.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/71e5672587cdd121.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about Alexandra Krosney that will wow you</span></p></a><h3>Pictures of Fiona Shaw young will surprise you</h3><p class=align-left>We are used to seeing her as she is: almost no makeup, a simple and convenient hairstyle, comfortable clothes, and her very special smile. Still, some rare pictures of her youth may surprise you.</p><p class=align-left>It is hard to recognise the actress in this picture, so young she is.
