My administration will never do anything that will threaten the rule of law. We will always uphold the customs and traditions of the Judiciary. We never break down the laid down procedure.</i></p><p><i>"We will never run contrary to our avowed commitment to respect the independence of the Judiciary at all times."</i></p><p>Governor Wike charged the new Chief Judge to always uphold the constitution and carry other members of the bench along in the decision making process.</p><p>The NJC recommended the appointment of Justice Daisy Wotube Okocha as Chief Judge of Rivers State on July 22, 2013, while the Court of Appeal on December 23, 2015 set aside a Federal High Court judgment which had initially ruled that the state governor is not bound to comply with the recommendation of the NJC.</p><p>In her remarks after being sworn in, the new Rivers State Chief Judge, Justice Daisy Wotube Okocha thanked God for making her elevation possible after two years of uncertainty.</p><p>Justice Okocha said: <i>"This is a solemn moment for me. The NJC recommendation of 22nd July, 2013 came to manifestation on Monday, 4th January, 2016. God has glorified himself in my elevation as Chief Judge.</i></p><p><i>"Man can try, but only God’s counsel will prevail."</i></p><p>She commended Governor Wike for giving the Judiciary the required independence to carry out its constitutional responsibilities.</p><p>The state Judiciary was in crisis for more than a year over the struggle over who is rightful person to head the Judiciary as the Chief Judge.</p><p>Justice Peter Agumagu politically became the choice of All Progressive Congress (APC) while Justice Daisy Okocha expectedly became the preferred choice for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p><p>The exit of Amaechi on May 29 and assumption of office of Governor Wike put paid to the logjam as Justice Okocha was sworn in Acting Capacity as Chief Chief Judge.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mBk25sZp%2Bfq7Kzus6rZLChm5p6tMPEmqmsZZaev7TAjJ%2BcppmcmnqktMienWaipZm0pnnRoq2eqqNiwLWt055krJmZmXqxtM6tpqxmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./386776-nigerian-politicians-who-betrayed-pdp-and-joined-apc-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Politicians Who Betrayed PDP And Joined APC</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./353639-demu-aacha-kazi-kuhepa-mwajiri-fisi-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Demu aacha kazi kuhepa mwajiri 'fisi'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
