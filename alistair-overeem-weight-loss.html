Now, Alistair has announced some major changes that have also put an end to his career as a fighter.</p><p>Alistair, who has been fighting professionally for 25 years, announced the news on the podcast Lovin' Dubai, and also discussed his substantial weight loss. Alistair's weight loss went viral after a photo of him looking shockingly thin hit the internet in June. Now, many want to understand both Alistair's weight loss and his decision to retire.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the reason for Alistair's weight loss?</h2><p>On the podcast, Alistair said that he had lost a bunch of weight after meeting with a nutritionist and deciding to become a vegetarian.</p><p>“He’s like, ‘Yep, we’re gonna detox.’ I’m like a soldier,” Alistair explained said. “’Okay, let’s go.’ When I met him, I instantly knew this guy has knowledge, so we started working, and I started taking these supplements in a reasonably high dosage, which you can just do on an empty stomach. And after a couple of weeks, my diet, my appetite changed.”</p><p>Alistair had previously been known to eat steak at 8 a.m. to build muscle and regularly ingest horse meat, but he said that his diet changed pretty quickly.</p><p>"When I spoke to Julian [the nutritionist], I asked him what’s happening,” Alistair said. “I don’t want to eat my steak anymore, but I want to eat my steak because I want muscles."</p><p>"And he said, ‘You had parasites in your body. We gave you the supplements, you start detoxing your body,’ and these supplements are just simple seaweed," the former fighter continued.</p><p>"It’s not me who needs to eat meat, it’s the parasites that influence me, work through me to make me think I want to eat meat, but it’s not me. And once you get rid of them, you don’t care," Alistair added.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alistair also announced his retirement.</h2><p>During the interview, Alistair, who is now 43, also announced that he was giving up fighting during his appearance on the podcast.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I actually just decided to stop fighting,” Alistair said casually. “This is not my thing anymore. It’s been 25 years, right? We’re going to do other cool stuff now.”</p><p style=text-align:start>What Alistair meant was that he would spend more time promoting health in the way that he did throughout his time on the podcast.</p><p>Alistair is a former Strikeforce and DREAM champion who was released from the UFC in March of 2021. Over the course of his professional career, he had a record of 47-19 and proved himself to be a reliable fighter inside the ring.</p><p>Some fans were likely alarmed by the image of Alistair looking so skinny when for most of his career as a fighter he's intentionally built muscle. Thankfully, though, his new appearance had little to do with any health problems and was instead just an attempt to reset his body after a physically demanding career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmqv9OaoKtln6uys7HEpmSwnZmctbV5y6iqrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-write-you-from-a-place-of-hope-and-pain-hushpuppis-friend-pac-celebrates-him-on-his-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;I Write You From A Place Of Hope And Pain</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-garden-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Garden - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
