If you don’t go there and kill, you are going to have a big problem – and that’s what happened. Now is the time to learn from it and improve. We are doing so well this season, but there are still things to improve for everyone, as individuals and as a team.”</p><h2>The Ball Came Perfectly For Me – Antony On First Goal For United</h2><p>After netting his first goal for the Red Devils on Sunday, United’s new signing, Antony said he was happy to have contributed to the club’s victory against Arsenal.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that United completed the signing of the Brazilian player from Ajax for a fee of £86m last week.</p><p>The 22-year-old put Ten Hag’s men in the lead yesterday after scoring the opening goal against <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Arsenal.</strong></a></p><p>Sharing his experience at Old Trafford so far and his contribution to Sunday evening’s victory, Anthony said to journalists; “Marcus passed the ball to perfection so when it came [to me], there was not much more I had to do,” said Antony somewhat modestly.</p><p>“I saw the goalkeeper and the ball just came perfectly to me to place it as I did. I was very happy to just go with my instinct.”</p><p>Speaking on the other performances that saw United to winning all three points at home, Antony commended his teammates, especially, Marcus Rashford who provided him with the pass for his dream moment.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Rashford later went on to score twice himself during the game to earn United 3-1, a bruise to Bukayo Saka’s equalizer for the visiting team.</p><p>“Bruno Fernandes had the ball, I think he shrugged off Gabriel Jesus, and then he touched the ball to Jadon Sancho,” said Anthony during an interview.</p><p>He added: “Sancho made the touch to Marcus and I knew he could slip the ball either way. And when Marcus, being a very intelligent player, realised I could make a run, I just took off. He slipped the ball and I took the chance well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49uZp6onGLEpnnPpZiynZRir6bA056pZqyYlrtuucCnZK6mmamypXnGmpmroZWhequx0q6qZqugmq6sv4yopWaZoqiyr63LrGRsZWFisaayxJqrZpmkYrytsIytqZqelqS%2FpXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./484675-lagos-2025-governor-ambode-state-development-plan-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lagos-2025: Governor Ambode &amp;amp; State Development Plan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-neff-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will Neff - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
