This government is very, very divisive. Right now, this country is divided along religious and ethnic lines. We don’t need that. This government is very deceitful,”</i> he said.</p><p>Onovo accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of reneging on many of its campaign promises.</p><p>As an example, he recalled how the party had promised to create 3 million jobs, but instead there has been “millions of job loss”.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>‘God chose President Muhammadu Buhari for Nigeria’</p><p><i>“If you don’t believe it, I have a document titled APC manifesto 2015. The document was signed by John Oyegun, national chairman of the ruling party.</i></p><p><i>“One of the things written there is 3 million jobs every year, but what have we seen? Instead of 3 million new jobs, it’s millions of job loss. In the document was immediate recruitment of 100,000 police officers, what have we seen? Announcement to recruit 10,000. The document also promised to increase the salaries of five security agencies, but what are we seeing, debt, owing salaries and allowances, even that of soldiers in the north-east. So if that is not deceitful, what is?”</i> he wondered.</p><p>Onovo also accused President Buhari of abusing the laws and the constitution of the country.</p><p><i>“The constitution is very clear about so many issues, one is appointment. The other time a national newspaper published how out of 37 appointments, 30 were given from a section of the country. Now, what is that supposed to be? Look at the security appointment, six major appointments were made, and anybody who is a nationalist would have given one position to each of the geopolitical zones.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;‘This is change to madness. This is change to poverty’ – Ex-minister to Buhari</p><p><i>“I don’t want to go further, because if I give further information that I have, which I can confirm, it can be incisive, so I don’t want to give that level of information. Six major security positions were announced and the same sections of the country that were complaining of exclusion and marginalisation were left out, contrary to the constitution of Nigeria. Federal character is very clear; it’s a constitutional requirement, not a political requirement," </i>he noted.</p><p>Speaking about the 2016 budget, Onovo could not say anything good about it.</p><p><i>“These things are simple; it’s not because I belong to the opposition. We have heard a lot of things, we have heard of stolen budget, we have heard of padding, we have heard of missing budget, we heard of re-presentation of the budget. Which scandal have we not heard of?”</i> he wondered.</p><p>The president received the comprehensive details of 2016 national budget on April 7.&nbsp;</p><p>After scrutinizing the budget, it was discovered that the lawmakers removed some major projects like the Calabar-Lagos coastal rail line for which Buhari made a provision of N60 billion.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHqBj29qZpqlna6ztdJmnqiupGK0s7HArZysrF2Zrq%2BzxKtknrBdpb%2Bmv8idnKesmZa5bq%2FAp5uinJGpsm7DwKulZqaZnLKztcCnqmegpKK5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-jeffree-and-nathan-meet.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Did Jeffree and Nathan Meet?
