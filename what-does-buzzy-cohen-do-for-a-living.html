But if you believe that, you probably aren't that well-acquainted with the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Just take a look at <a href=#>Buzzy Cohen</a>, who was selected as a guest-host for the long-running program after clocking a nine-game winning streak.

While its name sounds like it specializes in assisting the world's youth in getting involved in politics from a young age, it's actually a brand that makes jingles for commercials.</p><p>And its website is really, really good. The company has worked for some super high-profile companies like Facebook, Nike, Mountain Dew, Smirnoff, Infiniti, HP, Lyft, Instagram, Tinder, Chobani, and others. Not bad!</p><p>Buzzy was also the managing director of Squeak-E-Clean productions and a senior music supervisor at TBWA/Media Arts Lab, per his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Buzzy enjoyed a whopping nine-game winning streak as a contestant on Jeopardy! and was dubbed "Mr. Personality" by Alex Trebek during his time on the show for his enthusiasm and passion for the game.</p><p>He's been pinned to host the Tournament of Champions for the show, which disqualifies him as a potential contestant from here on out. However, many believe that we'll be seeing a lot more of Buzzy on Jeopardy! for many years to come.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is and will always be Alex's stage.

I didn't think anything would come of it, and I certainly wasn't calling&nbsp;Sony, being like, 'Hey, can I get a shoutout?'"
