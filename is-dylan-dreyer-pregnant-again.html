The meteorologist sometimes fills in for Al Roker or Carson Daly, and she's also been known for her appearances on The Weather Channel. Given her consistent presence on Today, though, and how public she is about motherhood, fans have started to wonder whether she may be expecting again.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Dylan Dreyer pregnant again? Yes!</h2><p>Rumors had been spreading that Dylan might be pregnant with a third kiddo, but it wasn't until Tuesday, May 11 that we got confirmation: Yes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan Dreyer is pregnant again</a>! The meteorologist announced that she and her husband, Brian Fichera, are expecting baby No. 3 in November of 2021 —&nbsp;and it will be their third boy!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In the past, <a href=#>Dylan</a> has been fairly open on Today about her parenting struggles. She gave birth to her first son, Calvin, in 2016, and her second son, Oliver, in January of last year. Dylan said on the show that she's excited to add another boy to the mix: "I don’t have to add any toys!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dylan Dreyer (@dylandreyernbc)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dylan's sons had surgery three days apart.</h2><p>Although Dylan hasn't announced another pregnancy, she has been open with Today viewers about the scary chapters she's already had in her life as a parent. In July of last year, Dylan's sons had to have separate surgeries three days apart. Calvin had surgery to get his tonsils removed, and Oliver, who was only six months old at the time, was having routine surgery. Thankfully, everything went well and both boys are okay.&nbsp;</p><p>The surgeries weren't initially supposed to be so close together, but because of COVID-19, they wound up happening during the same week. &nbsp;</p><p>"We didn't intend for their surgeries to be back-to-back but because of COVID[-19], everything got rearranged," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>. "Calvin got his tonsils out. He was a trooper, he's already feeling a whole lot better. Oliver had surgery too."</p><p>Dylan also said that her husband, Brian Fichera, was not allowed to be present for the surgeries because of COVID restrictions, which only made the experience more stressful. &nbsp;"Because of COVID, [Brian] and I both couldn't go, so I'm trying to carry my pumps, my cooler bag, my diaper bag, Oliver post-surgery, trying to hold him gently — I just didn't have enough hands,” she explained. “It was a challenge going through it alone."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dylan Dreyer (@dylandreyernbc)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dylan underwent a miscarriage prior to having her second son.</h2><p>In addition to the woes of being a parent during a pandemic, Dylan also had to deal with the heartbreak of suffering a miscarriage before the birth of her second son. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview</a> on Today, Dylan recounted the experience of realizing she'd had a miscarriage, and then having to put on a brave face for her work on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m devastated, and I have to go to work on the Today Show and be happy and smiling and pretend like nothing’s wrong,” she explained.&nbsp;</p><p>Eventually, her co-workers realized there was something wrong and she confided in them. Dylan struggled to have a second child because of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">secondary infertility,</a> which about 3 million women in the US suffer from. The condition makes it harder to have a second biological child after having the first.&nbsp;</p><p>Which makes it all the more exciting that the family will soon be snuggling another little bundle of joy. Congratulations to Dylan, Brian, Calvin, and Oliver!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusNilmKdllKeyurHRZqernZejrq%2FAjJqemqGe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-collins-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kris Collins - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1126732-importance-entrepreneurship-developing-countries-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Importance of entrepreneurship in developing countries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
