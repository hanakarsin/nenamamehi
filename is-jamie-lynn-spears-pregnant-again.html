While her pregnancy had nothing to do with the show ending, it still took a hit to Jamie Lynn's career.</p><p>Now, there are <a href=#>rumors of a reboot in the works</a> — and also rumors that Jamie Lynn <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">might be pregnant again</a>. But is Jamie Lynn actually pregnant?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Jamie Lynn Spears with her daughter, Maddie Aldridge.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Jamie Lynn Spears pregnant again?</h2><p>In April, Jamie Lynn's fans began to wonder if the star was potentially pregnant after she posted a shot on her Instagram with what looked like a quickly-growing baby bump. The photo showed her in a floral dress, cradling the bump while holding another small girl in her arms. And since that picture was posted, her feed has continued to be filled with other photos showing off the bump as it slowly gets bigger.</p><p>But if you're not paying closer attention to her feed, you'll miss that this baby bump is part of a character she's playing.</p><p>"Guesss whatttt???" she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned</a> the original photo of the bump. "NO, I’m not pregnant, but Noreen is, and I’m so excited I can finally share the official release date for #SWEETMAGNOLIAS is MAY 19 2020 on @netflix Now, y’all run and tell everyone you know and add it to your watchlist!!!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Noreen is coming back for yalllllll👆🏻🙈 I’m so excited and honored to officially announce that SEASON 2 of #SWEETMAGNOLIAS is happening!!!!

But Jamie Lynn herself is not pregnant.</p><p>After giving birth to her eldest daughter, Maddie Briann Aldridge, at only 17, Jamie Lynn took a break from her acting career to raise her child with now-ex Casey Aldridge. She now has another child, Ivey Joan Watson, who is only two.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Jamie Lynn Spears' husband?</h2><p>After splitting with Casey in 2010, Jamie Lynn later began dating Jamie Watson. The pair dated on and off for a few years before getting engaged in 2013. They got married in 2014, and just four years later announced they were pregnant with Ivey.</p><p>But Jamie (her husband) does not have the high profile upbringing that Jamie Lynn did. He apparently had no idea of his wife's famous sister when they met, and admitted in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, “I’m just a normal guy with a normal job.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Jamie Lynn's husband is the owner of Advanced Media Partners, a company that sells high-end electronics to corporations, and actually has no direct connection with Hollywood. In fact, the duo met through mutual friends.</p><p>One thing many of her fans have noticed, though, is the age gap between the two of them. Jamie is nine years older than Jamie Lynn, providing a significant age difference that often raises a few brows in Hollywood. But the two seem to be comfortable in their marriage together.</p><p>“I knew I wanted to marry her when basically I had fallen in love with Maddie just as much as her,” he said of falling in love with Jamie Lynn, according to Us Weekly. “And I couldn’t not be a part of her or Maddie’s life.”</p><p>“I didn’t feel anxious or any of that stuff. I just felt safe,” Jamie Lynn also admitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsCmoJ5lnK67r3nSqZyaqqNivbOxxqeYp6xdlrSitc0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./426540-mamake-sharon-otieno-asema-alimuonya-bintiye-dhidi-ya-kuwa-mpenzi-wa-gavana-obado-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mamake Sharon Otieno Asema Alimuonya Bintiye Dhidi ya Kuwa Mpenzi wa Gavana Obado</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dad-daughter-time-off-school-grief.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dad Doesn't Let Daughter Skip School to Grieve Mom's Death</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
