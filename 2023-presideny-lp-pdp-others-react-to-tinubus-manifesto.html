In 2023, Nigerians are going to be interested in records. APC is not known to keep promises and that is why they have been referred to as All Promises Cancelled. The party is in liquidation and they are dying in instalments.”</p><p>On that premise, Ologunagba maintained that their current performance record would tell at the polls next year.</p><p>A political analyst, <strong>Jide Ojo</strong>, told the newspaper that he thinks the manifesto only sounds good on the surface, but Tinubu and the APC should be questioned on how they think they can deliver on their manifesto if elected in 2023.</p><p>“How are we sure that there would be no truckload of excuses if he wins and forms a new government?” he queried.</p><p>On his part, a financial analyst, <strong>Kalu Aja</strong>, described the APC’s manifesto as a tough sell because the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth projection should be queried.</p><p>Aja said, “this is the GDP growth projection of Bola Tinubu of the APC, it’s a straight automatic 10 per cent every year from 2023. Mathematically, this is a tough sell; as GDP grows, growth stalls because the denominator grows bigger.”</p><p>An associate pProfessor of Economics at Pan-Atlantic University, <strong>Dr Olalekan Aworinde</strong>, said that the APC’s manifesto undoubtedly can be achieved but not without certain factors to be considered.</p><p>“One fundamental thing is that when the Buhari government first came into power, they also promised us all of these. But how many of these were they able to achieve?”</p><p>The Dean of the School of Business and Entrepreneurship at the American University of Nigeria, <strong>Professor Leo Ukpong</strong>, said “to move an economy forward from the depressed economy that Nigeria is facing is like moving a very big ship and it takes a lot of time. Nigeria’s economy is saddled with too much debt; our debt level is way too high.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FsZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6ueq28jKmbqWWfqbWmvtJmqZ6Zk6l6tbuMraCnrZKqwG65wKegn52jqbxw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1374455-safinatu-buhari-biography-who-muhammadu-buharis-wife-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Safinatu Buhari biography: Who was Muhammadu Buharis first wife?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./funke-akindele-speaks-after-going-into-a-trance-at-celestial-church.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Funke Akindele Speaks After Going Into A Trance At Celestial Church</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
