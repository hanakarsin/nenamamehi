Territorially, our land is being taken away; the people we look after are displaced, their homes, their villages and towns are captured and they are internally displaced, being refugees in their own land. We thought this is not right. We have families that are just stranded. We thought that the President should know. As Catholics, we have laid a good structure for relief and taking care of such situation, we want the government to collaborate with us,”</i> he said.</p><p>The bishops President further hinted that the meeting with the President was based on the bishops’ concerns about the security situation in the country as well as the political scenario. He revealed that the meeting was also geared towards reminding the Mr. President of what he already knows about.</p><p><i>“We just wanted to remind him of things he already knows, there was nothing we said that was new, we just wanted to lay emphasis and we wanted him to know we are concerned. The President is already doing his bit; he has assured us that he is on top of the situation. They are reviewing strategies and all that and by the grace of God this terrorism that we are witnessing will soon be a thing of the past. This is the assurance we are coming away with,”</i> Kaigama said.</p><p>Kaigama also disclosed that the delegation urged the President to include them in the process of registering displaced people due to their knowledge.</p><p></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Nigeria Is At War – Catholic Church</p><p><i>“So, we are telling government that we are aware of the wonderful effort they do, the relief they give through NEMA and other agencies, the effectiveness of the distribution is our concern.
