Here is a straightforward guide on how to download My Safaricom app on Android.</p><li><strong>Allow background data</strong>: Safely skip this step if you are using a Wi-Fi internet connection as background data is always unrestricted in the mode. If you are using SIM card data, unblock the option since most of the processes in this guide will often use background data. Google Android services will not function if you restrict their access to data, and therefore My Safaricom app install process will be unfruitful. To reduce data usage during this period, launch your task manager app and force stop all the background apps. You can also make use of apps like Purify and Greenfy to tame background processes and RAM (Random Access Memory) usage.</li><li><strong>Launch the Google Play store app</strong>: Go to your app list and then scroll down to the app, tap its icon and move to the next step.</li><li><strong>Search for “My Safaricom”</strong>: In the uppermost part of your screen, there is an app search box which will be of much assistance in this step. Using your keyboard, type in the app name in the box and press the OK button. Your results will be processed in a few seconds. Click on the application icon once you locate it.</li><li><strong>Tap the “install” button</strong>: After clicking on the app’s icon a new window opens. Here, you will see the app’s overall rating, screenshots, and customer reviews. You will see an “Install” button on the new window just before reviews and ratings. Click on it. A notification will appear with a list of all the permissions the app will have on your device. Before clicking on the “Accept” button, please review all the app permission and make sure you are comfortable with them.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/20fa87f5640364e4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A detailed guide on how to send files from Xender to PC or Macbook</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After accepting, your download will start automatically after a few seconds.
