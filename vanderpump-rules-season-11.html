Here's what fans can expect.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When will we see 'Vanderpump Rules' Season 11?</h2><p>Bravo's official announcement that the show had been renewed didn't include any information on when the new season could debut. Given that Season 10 is still airing, it seems unlikely that the show will return any time in the next few months. There was more than a year-long gap between Season 9 and Season 10, so we likely won't see Season 11 until sometime in 2024.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The show's current season is airing 9 p.m. on Wednesdays on Bravo, and the show has occupied that time slot for some time. Although the announcement didn't say when the new season would air on the broadcast schedule, the show will likely still occupy the same time slot when it returns for a new season, unless something unusual happens.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bravo also announced the renewal of a slew of other shows.</h2><p>Since it's become the home for some of the most popular reality TV programming around, Bravo announced that it would be renewing many other shows at the same time it made the announcement about Vanderpump Rules.</p><p>Among the shows renewed were Top Chef, a bunch of Real Housewives shows from across the country and Dubai, Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, Watch What Happens Live, Southern Hospitality, Below Deck, Southern Charm, Below Deck Mediterranean, Winter House, and Below Deck Down Under.</p><p>The official press release announcing all of these renewals also suggested that Bravo was setting streaming records for many of its shows on Peacock.</p><p>“Bravo is home to five of the top 10 unscripted reality shows across cable, and Bravo programming on Peacock is breaking records with the first three months of 2023 ranking as its most-watched on the streamer," the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">release explained</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>These <a href=#>#PumpRules</a> pictures are worth a thousand words. Just wait until you see the trailer… Click for more pics: <a href=#>https://t.co/TRpQmgQMe6</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dL9BaCRfLc</a></p>— Bravo (@BravoTV) <a href=#>May 11, 2023</a></figure><p>Vanderpump Rules is almost undoubtedly among those high-performing shows, given the fact that it shows up on the platform soon after a new episode airs. The episodes typically <a href=#>drop on Peacock</a> at around 6 a.m. EST on Thursdays, meaning that anyone who doesn't have a cable subscription can still catch up with the new episode soon after it's released.</p><p>Now that the show is coming back for Season 11, it seems that die-hard Vanderpump fans will have another reason to keep their Peacock subscription. Bravo realty series are certainly at the center of our pop culture conversation, and in the past few years, that has been especially true of Vanderpump Rules.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfq66vsMSrp66loGK%2FtrjErGSsnZGovK95kGo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-presidency-no-candidate-above-50-will-get-out-vote-arewa-youths.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>2023 Presidency: No Candidate Above 50 Will Get Out Vote</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zayn-malik-chest-tattoo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yes, Zayn Malik Has Gigi Hadids Eyes Tattooed on His Chest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
