The YouTubers have been teasing the collection for months now on their joint docuseries The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star. We feel like we were part of the process, considering how we saw it go from just an idea to a full-fledged line.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The collection is also being sold on Beautylish, but some potential buyers are wary of the site because it's received some mixed reviews in the comments section.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Is Beautylish legit?</a> Here's what you should know before making a purchase on the site.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Beautylish legit?</h2><p>The Shane Dawson X Jeffree Star collab has been marked on beauty gurus' calendars since it was first announced. The line ‚Äî which includes liquid lipsticks, a full-size palette, a mini palette, and merch ‚Äî is being sold on Jeffree Star's website, and on Beautylish.com.</p><p>Beautylish is a site that combines YouTube-esque videos with an online store. The site has tutorials, and makeup fanatics can share what they like and don't like about certain products, techniques, and makeup lines. The demos also allow fans to learn how to do more, and then buy products used in the videos.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the site is not directly affiliated with one particular brand, some customers were concerned that the site would take their money and give them knockoff products.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Many brands sell products through Beautylish, and while some people don't like buying products through a third party source, Beautylish is a legitimate site. One of the perks to ordering products through the site is that shipping is free on orders above $35 (which, as we know in the makeup world, is how much one product costs).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=#>Almost time! üîú The ShanexJeffree Conspiracy Collection launches tomorrow at 10am PDT / 1pm EDT on Beautylish. üê∑ . .

So, you can add products from some of the top makeup companies to one shopping cart and buy them all in one fell swoop.&nbsp;</p><p>The social aspect is unlike other makeup sites, too. Visitors on Beautylish can link things they like to their Pinterest or Facebook pages.&nbsp;</p><p>The site is well-reviewed, for the most part. Many customers liked how their products were secured with bubble wrap and other materials in order to ensure they didn't break in transit. The site also has products for hair, fragrance, and nails, making it truly a one-stop shop for beauty lovers.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Shane Dawson X Jeffree Star collab broke the internet (literally).</h2><p>When Shane released some merch with Jeffree on his site a few weeks ahead of the makeup collab, it became clear that the two would be an enviable business match. The merch sold out within hours, and the makeup launch has proven to be an even bigger deal.&nbsp;</p><p>The makeup launch, which has been sold through the e-commerce company, Shopify, crashed the site for several hours. Shopify is used in more than one million businesses, meaning that the crash had a huge effect on many companies.</p><p>The site crashed just 15 minutes after the launch went live, as a result of so many people trying to add items to their carts. Jeffree took to Twitter to thank his fans for showing such strong support, and he kept them updated as to when the site would be back up. The issue was seemingly resolved several hours later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBursSarK2xnJ7AqXnLnp6irA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-schilling-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Schilling - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./could-there-be-more-dragons-game-of-thrones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Everyone Is Wondering the Exact Same Thing About Daenerys' Dragons in 'Game of Thrones' Season 8, Ep</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
