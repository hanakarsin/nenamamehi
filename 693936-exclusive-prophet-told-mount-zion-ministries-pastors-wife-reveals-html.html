They wondered could God call someone into acting. We heard of pastors and other Christian ministries. But what is drama? An entertainment pursuit? They wondered, is there any future in this thing you are doing? Some of our parents even regretted ever sending some of us to school. They were greatly disappointed because it was also new to the church of God</i>.”</p><p>She added that as a result of this, we were not fully supported by our people and even by the church because, drama to them, then was of the world and to them, it was not spiritually wise for any child of God to venture into such a “<i>worldly</i>” thing.</p><p>Speaking on how many times they have been neglected by other ministries, Gloria Bamiloye disclosed that so many times, we have to convince some pastors to allow us minister in their churches by going to them with letters of request for permission to allow us minister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4ptrultnpur.jpg><p>She said: “<i>I remember we were coming from the northern part of the country where we have been for some weeks for drama ministrations in churches and we were being invited by a church in Ibadan for their convention. The pastor of the church was reluctant to allow us minister when he saw us looking shabby and rough in appearance due to the long journey and we had only come to present ordinary drama. He then told us he would only give us 30 minutes to present the full length play of one hour 30 minutes</i>.”</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>TB Joshua Emerges 13th World Most Popular Pastors<strong></strong></p><p>“<i>We agreed and we started the presentation, he stopped us at exactly 30 minutes, and we were about to start packing our loads when he stepped forward and told his people that as he was watching the drama, the Lord told him to pay attention and to tell his congregation they were not watching an ordinary drama and they should all pay attention, he then told us to continue the presentation. It was awesome as the Lord manifested His power greatly after the drama</i>.”</p><p>She further explained that after their performance, the pastor began to prophecy to them that their pictures would be seen at the farthermost corner of the earth preaching the gospel with their drama.</p><p>The story was sent in by Tope Olukole.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3p%2FmGxtZp2omLm2v8ivnGaooqS9qbHTZquopJRiurDBza1ks6Gfo3qutc2iqq2qmZrAbrzArKuoqqNixKqyxGapnq6Vlrm0esetpKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whostheboss-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who's the Boss? - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./championship-iheanacho-may-feature-in-leeds-united-vs-leicester-city-clash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Iheanacho May Feature In Leeds United Vs Leicester City Clash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
