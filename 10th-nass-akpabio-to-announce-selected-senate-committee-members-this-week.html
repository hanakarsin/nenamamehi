The idea was to name members of some of the committees that day.</p><p>“Akpabio sent a message to some senators to inform the presiding officer, his deputy, Senator Jibrin Barau, to delay the plenary until he returned from the Villa.</p><p>“But due to some issues like the jamming of the network within the chambers or members putting their phones in silence, those to whom the message was sent to were unable to access it before the end of the plenary.</p><p>“Some saw the message about 10 minutes after the Senate had adjourned. With that, the announcement of the composition of some of the committees could not be made.</p><p>&nbsp;“Now, the matter is this. Some former presidential aspirants and former governors, who worked with President Tinubu during the campaign, are also rooting for major committees that are more feasible. Nigerians refer to such committees as juicy ones.</p><p>“Such committees include appropriations, finance, army, works, customs, and foreign affairs, among others.</p><p>“Supporters of Senator Abdulaziz Yari are also coming back to bargain for the headship of some committees. But there is a possibility that they won’t get what they want. This is because there is precedence.</p><p>“When Bukola Saraki emerged as the President of the Senate, those who were foot soldiers of Senator Ahmad Lawan, who was also in the race for the Senate presidency, were left without heading any committee. The likes of Senator Solomon Adeola and others were denied any significant role during the period because of their loyalty to Lawan.”</p><p>Recall that the Senate Leader, <a href=# rel=noopener>Opeyemi Bamidele</a>, had said the next activity was to form other committees, following the Selection Committee, which would be responsible for that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49yZmpopJ16r63SrGSao6CWr6q7jK2mZpmeo7y2usKeZKydnJqwtbHDZqqeppGpsm6vzqakoqykmrJuucSmmZ6qo2LBqbXSZq6enZtk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-apollo-and-phaedra-parks-friends-rhoa.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Apollo Nida and Phaedra Parks From RHOA Friends?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./virgin-river-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Virgin River - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
