She wanted to see if her husband would notice how bad the bathroom was getting and perhaps do something about it.</p><p>She even gave a quick tour of the bathroom, showing that it was desperately overdue for a scrub.</p><p>But, guess what? Her husband didn't notice at all that their bathroom was covered in grime and begging for a clean.</p><p>That said, since he didn't step up to the plate, OP eventually had to clean the whole bathroom by herself ‚Äî and it was sparkling when she was done.</p><p>When she invited her husband in to see if he could notice a difference in their bathroom, his reaction was once again disappointing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mercy_festus href=#>@mercy_festus</a><p>Man eyes are a real thing üò≠ but also f**king annoying üò°@Dominic Murer <a title=cleaningasmr href=#>#cleaningasmr</a> <a title=cleaningtok href=#>#cleaningtok</a> <a title=bathroomcleaning href=#>#bathroomcleaning</a> <a title=marriagehumor href=#>#marriagehumor</a> <a title=husbandsoftiktok href=#>#husbandsoftiktok</a> <a title=cleaningtips href=#>#cleaningtips</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - I.M.I" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - I.M.I</a></figure><p>"Babe come look at the bathroom," she is heard saying in the video.</p><p>Her husband walked in and asked, "What about the bathroom?" While he seemed somewhat aware that there was something different about it, he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</p><p>"I mean you cleaned up your mess around the sink he said, referring to some beauty products OP had out on the counter. However, that's the only difference he noted.</p><p>Her husband failed to notice the bathtub, shower walls, and toilet had all been meticulously scrubbed.</p><p>OP even began to point out some of her work, but it was a lost cause. "I mean it looks the same, you just picked up your stuff," he said.</p><p>"You're joking, right?" she asked her husband, to which he responded, "No," later adding, "That's how the bathroom always looks."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@mercy_festus</a></figure><p>"'Man eyes' are a real thing, but also f------ annoying," wrote OP in her caption.</p><p>Thankfully, her video resonated with viewers, and women in the comment section bonded over her husband's aggravating response.</p><p>"My blood is boiling secondhand," wrote one user.</p><p>"Even the baby noticed a difference in the bathroom," another said, referring to how a young boy, who was presumably OP's son. He walked into the bathroom during the video and said, "What the heck?" in disbelief.</p><p>A third person wrote: "Nah, they see it. They just know you're going to do it," suggesting that her husband was just playing games.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@mercy_festus</a></figure><p>However, some folks were so off put by her husband's response that they believed it was grounds for divorce.</p><p>"No amount of love could make me put up with his BS. No amount!! I say‚Ä¶ divorce."</p><p>"Please get out of there. He clearly doesn‚Äôt value your time, effort, skill, emotional labor and literally you as a person," opined another.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@mercy_festus</a></figure><p>Meanwhile, others claimed her husband just looked unappreciative. "When I saw him I thought ahhh makes sense," read a comment.</p><p>All we know is that OP's husband better rewatch that video closely because his wife did a wonderful job cleaning and he owes her a big apology.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfncK0rsCnm2acn5rAr8CMnKOemZ5ir6LAx6umqKU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nnamdi-kanu-made-reckless-statements-let-the-law-prevail-ex-dss-boss.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nnamdi Kanu Made Reckless Statements, Let The Law Prevail</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lovecraft-country-plot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>The Plot of 'Lovecraft Country' on HBO Is Seriously Bone-Chilling</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
