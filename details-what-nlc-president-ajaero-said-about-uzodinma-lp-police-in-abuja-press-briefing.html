They mercilessly beat him and dragged him on the ground while also issuing death threats and suggesting that they would dispose of his body in a river.</p><p>“We heard that the workers who arrived at the protest venue as early as 7 am were beaten up, their belongings seized, and they were chased away.</p><p>“So, I arrived there by 9 am with about 20 security personnel and was about to address journalists on the situation when the police and other people in mufti came in and withdrew all the security there.</p><p>“They arrested me and handed me over to thugs who dragged me on the ground, hit me with all manner of things and tied my eyes. There were about seven of them.</p><p>“They started asking me why I was challenging Governor Hope Uzodinma, and that I should say my last prayers, and that they were going to throw me into Njaba River. From there, I did not know how the same people took me to the police headquarters,” the labour leader narrated.</p><p>Ajaero, who thanked God for his life, noted that the struggle would still have continued if he had died.</p><p>“Not even my death could have stopped the struggle for the payment of those workers. If I had died in the process, the people who would have taken over would have been more daring.</p><p>“Any of the deputies here that would take over would have been more decisive. So, nobody is backing out; it is a question of allowing justice to prevail and paying the people you are owing.</p><p>“He (Uzodinma) said I am playing local politics. I do not know which one is local politics. I am not a card-carrying member of any political party in Nigeria, and as a governor, he should be privileged to some classified information to be able to say which political party I belong to.</p><p>“But, I thank God that I am alive today. Whoever has diverted the workers money, has diverted blood money and has attracted generational curse,” he stated.</p><p>Refuting claims that he was partisan, the labour leader said: “I am not sure that anybody from my village is contesting for any election, not to talk of my family members.</p><p>“Anybody that is supporting the non-payment of workers salaries, him and his family, if they work, they will not do it. That is the mission. It is a divine mission.</p><p>“I do not have any family members or whatever running for election but they are free to run if they are interested. If I want to run for any office tomorrow, I will pick the form of any party.</p><p>“There is no law that forbids a civil servant from contesting elections. The appeal court has also made it clear. It needs permission for a protest or rally. You only inform the security.”</p><p>Speaking on his health condition, Ajaero stated that he will not be opting for medical treatment in foreign countries due to the NLC’s stance against medical tourism abroad.</p><p>He emphasized that he will remain in the country for medical attention until it becomes absolutely necessary to travel overseas, even if it means risking his life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5BpZp2dpJa2rb%2BMsJ%2BarF2juaR5z6ucrKGUmru1ecCjmJ6qn2LAorXDZpibp6WperbGzp2gp6WRYrmxec%2Boo6KblWK2r3nAm6yjmV2lv6a%2F0maZq6GVm7avs44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./you-all-shall-be-put-to-shame-fani-kayode-blasts-those-insinuating-tinubu-is-sick-or-dead.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>You All Shall Be Put To Shame Fani-Kayode Blasts Those Insinuating Tinubu Is Sick Or Dead</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./september27-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>September 27 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
