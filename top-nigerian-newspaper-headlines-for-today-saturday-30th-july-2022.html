This week, schools in the FCT were forced to vacate, with the 2022 call-to-bar ceremony moved from the Nigerian Law School’s headquarters in Bwari to a venue behind the EFCC headquarters in Abuja.</p><p>Northern Christians on Friday rejected the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the ruling&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC)&nbsp;that produced Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Senator Kashim Shettima as the Presidential candidate and running mate, respectively, for the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>The Christian leaders arrived at the decision during the APC Northern Christians Leader Summit in conjunction with Christians from the north held on Friday at the Nicon Luxury Hotel, Abuja.</p><p>The Christian leaders described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as a plan to “economically and politically marginalise Northern Christians.”</p><p>The Christian leaders stated that no Christian would vote for&nbsp;Bola Tinubu&nbsp;and Shettima in next year’s election.</p><p>Speaking as the Chairman of the event, former Secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, said that the Muslim-Muslim ticket was an extension of the exclusion of Christians from the scheme of things in the country.</p><p>The&nbsp;Nigerian Army&nbsp;has announced the redeployment of some top officers as well as the appointment of others into various positions.</p><p>The appointments which are with immediate effect are based on the approval of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS),&nbsp;Major-General Farouk Yahaya.</p><p>In a statement on Friday by the Army spokesperson,&nbsp;Brig.-General Onyema Nwachukwu, the senior officers were posted to command and instructional formations and units.</p><p>Nwachukwu stated that the redeployment of the top officers was an effort to reposition the Nigerian Army for operational efficiency and proficiency.</p><p>He said those affected in the redeployment released on Thursday include some Principal Staff Officers of the Army Headquarters, General Officers Commanding, Corps Commanders, Commandants of training institutions, Brigade Commanders, and Commanding Officers, amongst others.</p><p>Terrorists have launched another daring attack against the troops of the Guards Brigade responsible for the protection of President Muhammadu Buhari and other top government officials.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;gathered the attack occurred on Thursday night around the Zuma Rock, Madalla area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).</p><p>The terrorists believed to be members of the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) reportedly attacked the 102 Guards Battalion around 9 pm leading to the death of some soldiers on duty.</p><p>It was further gathered that the terrorists attempted to take over the military facility but were repelled by the troops who also had reinforcement help from other close security agencies including the Police.</p><p>The attack comes hours after Sunday’s ambush attack on the presidential guards brigade in the Bwari area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Sunday, Naija News reports.</p><p>Ahead of the 2023 general elections, Nigerians have been calling for an alternative to the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The disappointment in the two major parties and the woes that have befallen the country led to the quest for an alternative or Third Force.</p><p>The call for an alternative party or, simply put, a ‘Third Force’ led some notable Nigerians to form groups like the Coalition for Nigeria Movement (CNM), the Nigeria Intervention Movement (NIM), the Alliance for the Defense of Democracy (ADD), the Rescue Nigeria Movement (RNM) and the National Consultative Front (NCFront).</p><p>Among the groups, the NCFront, unveiled in 2020, offered a semblance of seriousness due to the prominent Nigerians that promoted the movement. Former Kano Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso also spearheaded the National Movement (TNM).</p><p>However, TNM metamorphosed into the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) with Kwankwaso as its presidential candidate and Archbishop Isaac Idahosa as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. The NNPP is also fighting for the ‘third force position’ with the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Labour Party (LP), and other parties.</p><p>Governor&nbsp;Nyesom Wike&nbsp;of Rivers State has broken silence on the recent interview of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>Atiku&nbsp;had, in an interview on Arise TV last week Friday, suggested that he could not work amicably with the governor as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>The former vice president had said he chose someone with “the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless All Progressives Congress government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.”</p><p>He added: “But you must understand that it’s the prerogative of the candidate to pick his running mate — a running mate he believes he can work with amicably, and then also deliver the policies of the party, and also try to unify the country.”</p><p>Atiku, however, added that he would soon meet with the Rivers governor to resolve any lingering issues between them.</p><p>Speaking with reporters on Friday morning at the Port Harcourt International Airport, Wike accused Abubakar of lies and deceit in his recent interview with Arise News.</p><p>The Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has reacted to the move by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senators to impeach President&nbsp;Muhammadu Buhari&nbsp;over the insecurity plaguing the nation.</p><p>Recall that&nbsp;Naija News&nbsp;reported that the opposition senators led by the Senate Minority Leader,&nbsp;Felix Aduda, gave the president six weeks to end insecurity in the nation or face impeachment.</p><p>Reacting to the incident via a statement on Thursday signed by its spokesman&nbsp;Jare Ajayi, Afenifere condemned the senate president Ahmed Lawan for stopping the senators from addressing the unrest in the country.</p><p>They questioned Lawan’s loyalty towards the nation and wondered if he truly wanted to end the menace or assist in festering it.</p><p>Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has stated that he has no plans to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) due to the crisis rocking the party.</p><p>Wike made this known to journalists on Friday at the Port Harcourt International Airport in the Rivers State capital, shortly after he returned from Spain.</p><p>The governor said he decided to keep quiet concerning the situation in the&nbsp;PDP&nbsp;because he has so much love for the opposition party.</p><p>Wike, however, stated that is time to let Nigerians know the truth about the crisis rocking the party.</p><p>Islamic cleric, Sheikh&nbsp;Ahmad Gumi&nbsp;has condemned the Federal Government for threatening to sanction the BBC and Daily Trust over their recent documentaries on terrorism.</p><p>Naija News had earlier reported that the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed on Thursday threatened that President Muhammadu Buhari-led government would sanction the platforms in due time.</p><p>Mohammed accused the news platforms of glorifying terrorists with their interviews.</p><p>Gumi in his reaction claimed that the Buhari government is trying to find a scapegoat to justify its failure.</p><p>He accused the government of wasting $16 billion in the last seven years without result on security.</p><p>Former Rivers South East Senator, Magnus Abe has joined the Social Democratic Party (PDP), days after dumping the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>The development was confirmed on Friday by his spokesperson,&nbsp;Party Benson.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;recalls the Rivers State politician had fallen out with the APC after losing the party’s governorship ticket and&nbsp;vowed not to support&nbsp;the candidate that emerged from the governorship primaries,&nbsp;Tonye Cole.</p><p>He also has a running political battle with former Minister of Transportation,&nbsp;Rotimi Amaechi.</p><p>Abe&nbsp;dumped APC&nbsp;last week but said he would get another platform to actualize his governorship ambition. He also added that he would be confirming his next political decision later.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
