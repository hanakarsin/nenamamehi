Read on for more details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After putting in a hard day's work, there's nothing better than kicking back and mindlessly scrolling through the "Am I the A--hole" subreddit. Every day, multiple people take to <a href=#>AITA</a> to explain their real-world interpersonal conflicts and receive judgment (or support) from fellow Redditors.</p><p>On May 16, 2023, a woman took to the popular subreddit to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">share</a> her recent experience riding the bus. The original poster, who goes by the handle u/throwaway5848387, said she took up two seats — and let's just say the comments weren't pretty. Read on for more details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">AITA? This Reddit user said she took up two seats on a bus.</h2><p>The woman began by providing context, stating that she's a 19-year-old U.S. resident who rides the bus because she can't afford "a car, insurance, gas, etc." She then went into the story.</p><p>The OP said she boarded an almost empty bus with heavy bags from a shopping trip; they "hardly fit" in front of her legs, so she placed them on the seat next to her. Although it wasn't initially crowded, more and more people hopped on as the ride went on. This led to some having to stand rather than sit on the bus.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>The woman said she never moved her bag and didn't offer the seat next to her to anyone because, in her experience, "most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway, and a lot of the time, people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know."</p><p>At the last stop, someone approached the OP and said something along the lines of, "You could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit, not just you."</p><p>The OP said she didn't respond because she didn't know what to say. She further noted that this person never asked her to move her bags, but if they did, she "probably would have." Yeah, sure.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Reddit users were enraged and didn't hold back in the comments.</h2><p>As expected, Reddit deemed the OP an a--hole. The top comment, which earned 39, 200 upvotes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reads</a>, "YTA; if there is no seat, [move your] f--king bag lol. How can u write [this] and think u aren't [the a--hole]?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/thiswonderfulhell</a></figure><p>"Wow — I really thought it would be another one where some creep made her move her bags when there were empty seats because he wanted to sit next to the young girl," another Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>. "Nope — as soon as the bus fills up, you move your stuff. YOU might rather stand, but many people would way rather sit."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/HRMisHere</a></figure><p>Many agreed the OP was selfish: "OP is so selfish; it's just gross," one Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, while a second person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> that not moving the bags for someone to take a seat was "incredibly rude and selfish."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/Background-Lab-4896</a></figure><p>"YTA. Once the bus started getting more crowded to the point where people were standing, you should have moved your bags. You shouldn't need to be asked to do so; it's just common courtesy," a fellow Redditor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>.</p><p>Another user didn't hold back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, "YTA. You saw the bus was full and didn't move your bags. That's exactly what rude a--holes do."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/Ephemeral-laremehp3</a></figure><p>"I rode the bus from when I was 18 until I was 35, including buying groceries for two people, so yeah, I'd use an empty seat next to me for my bags, but once the bus is really filling up, you put your s--t on your lap," a third <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">penned</a>.</p><p>Where do you stand? Should she have moved her bags?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflra1rYytmKShnpx6tryMra6oZaOarrW%2FjKilZqyYmnqjwdI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-buckley-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Buckley - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./269572-how-check-crb-status-online-kenya-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to check CRB status online in Kenya: guide and options</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
