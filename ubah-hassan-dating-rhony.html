While she kept him a secret from Bravo fans for months, we received a glimpse of Ubah's new beau.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see who the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubah Hot</a> CEO is dating!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is 'RHONY' star Ubah Hassan dating?</h2><p>In October 2023, Ubah gagged Bravoholics everywhere when she stepped out with her previously well-kept secret, Oliver Daschel.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> was the first to report that Ubah made her first public appearance with her boyfriend, Oliver, on Oct. 24, 2023. The pair attended the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 American Ballet Theatre Fall Gala</a> at NYC’s Lincoln Center together and snapped a few photos on the building’s staircase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Ubah dazzled in a silver cocktail dress, red lipstick, and red nails as she beamed into Oliver’s eyes. According to Page Six, Oliver is a German Investment banker who, based on the photos alone, seems equally smitten with Ubah.</p><p>Ubah revealed during part one of the <a href=#>RHONY Season 14 reunion</a> that she and “Mr. Connecticut” were going strong since filming wrapped, which was about a year before the reunion. While she remained tight-lipped about her boyfriend’s name and occupation, her co-stars agreed that he was her perfect match, with <a href=#>Jessel Taank</a> noting they “balanced” each other out.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ubah’s boyfriend became a hot topic during ‘RHONY’ Season 14.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In Season 14, Episode 13, <a href=#>Sai de Silva's husband, David</a>, asked Ubah why she was still single. This prompted Ubah to pull out her phone and covertly show Sai some photos of Ubah and a mystery man. Ubah told Sai she hadn't told anyone else about the relationship, and Sai promised to keep it on the down-low.</p><p>When a producer asked Ubah about why she was keeping the information private from the others, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubah said</a> that the relationship was "something very new … in the last year or so. I don’t want anyone else’s energy. I just want to make decisions for myself.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But not only did Sai accidentally slip and let <a href=#>Erin Lichy</a> know about Ubah's secret dating life during the season finale while they were on camera — but Sai apparently also told Erin and <a href=#>Brynn Whitfield</a> about it during a night of drinking.</p><p>“The difference between me telling Erin about Ubah dating someone on camera — it was a total accident,” Sai explained. “I told her and I instantly regretted it. Me telling Brynn? All right, I spilled the beans. I was drinking. I asked her specifically please do not say anything.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But Brynn did say something, all right — she loudly asked Ubah about it while the ladies were attending Brynn's birthday party. "I heard you got a man in Connecticut!” Brynn said to Ubah.</p><p>Ubah was not happy about this, and she ended up leaving the party while mad at both Sai and Brynn.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have a soft spot for Brynn and what she did was wrong but I think she was birthday drunk, you know? I also don’t think she knew the level of private Ubah was trying to be/would be that upset since she didn’t say a name or anything.</p>— Liberty VanZandt (@B_forBeautiful) <a href=#>October 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“The whole thing was confidential,” Ubah explained. “So, [Brynn] must have heard it from Sai. But for Brynn to mention a part of that, I’m just like, ‘B---h, you don’t deserve a birthday.'”</p><p>At the end of the season finale, we learned that the mystery man had come to New York to meet the other Housewives. But will he appear on the show next season? Ubah told host Andy Cohen on the Oct. 8, 2023, episode of Watch What Happens Live: “That’s a question we’re going to have to ask him.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Meanwhile, Andy said during the episode that he'd met this mystery man, who he described as "very handsome, strong, and, yes, formidable."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ubah Hassan's dating history prior to joining 'RHONY' may surprise you.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Ubah has done a good job at maintaining her privacy, but there was at least one relationship of hers that went public for a short time. A story broken by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> on Nov. 3, 2014 claimed that she was spending time with Lava Records founder Jason Flom, whose labels roster includes artists such as Jesse J and <a href=#>Lorde</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ubah never confirmed or denied that relationship, but Jason said nothing but wonderful things about her. “I don’t publicly discuss details of my dating life. Ubah is an amazing girl. She is smart, beautiful, and talented, and I’m happy to support her in her charitable endeavors,” Jason told Page Six.</p><p>She also posted a quick <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> on her Instagram on Dec.10, 2022 of her out to dinner with a man named Darnell Dodson, but it appears to be nothing but an innocent dinner, as he is not spotted again on her social media since that night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqq%2BitIyhmKyrkaN6pa3ToqWgZaKdvK%2FF</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-the-llama-masked-singer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is the Llama on 'The Masked Singer'?
