He said the times become even more challenging as the 2015 elections approach.</p><p><i>“Therefore, we all owe it a duty to our country, a duty to ourselves and a duty to the generations of Nigerians yet unborn to put our country first, and put it back on the path of development and the path of greatness,”</i> Oyegun said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Why Sokoto Didn’t Welcome Tambuwal - Prof Bashar</a></p><p>Buhari in his remark recalled the coming together of the legacy parties and paid tributes to their leaders for the sacrifice that made APC a reality. He commended the courage and wisdom of Tambuwal for adjourning the House sitting till December after announcing his defection to the party.</p><p>It is however, believed that the APC constitution amendment is to favour a particular aspirant and the search light is beamed on the former head of state, Gen. Mohammadu Buhari, as it would be recalled that Buhari's supporters under the auspices of Youth Congress for Change (BYCC), recently criticised a renowned Islamic scholar Sheikh Ahmad Gumi over his <a href=#>open letter to General Muhammadu</a> Buhari, advising him to forget his 2015 presidential ambition.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHJ%2FmG5rZpmgmHqisM6pq6xlnprEbsDAnKuim6NiwbB5z6KapGWTlrultcOaq56rXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-abdelkader-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Abdelkader - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./november-16-1988-la-brea.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Much Like 'Back to the Future,' 'La Brea' Is Hyper Focused on One Date What's Going On?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
