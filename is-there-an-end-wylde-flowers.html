While you, the player, have some say over the direction you take your character, including who you romance, it veers off from a traditional farming simulator in that there is, technically, an end.</p><p>Unfortunately, once you complete your first year on your farm, your story will come to a close. While the game will let you continue your save file, opening it in the spring, there are no new quests and you can't advance past that spring season.</p><p>This varies greatly from other simulator games, like <a href=#>Animal Crossing</a> and <a href=#>Stardew Valley</a>, as you'll have to either start an entirely new game or find another to play once you've finished your first year in Wylde Flowers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can you continue 'Wylde Flowers' after the credits roll?</h2><p>Though the game was initially created as a narrative-first story, naturally coming to a close at the end of your first year on the farm, many of the players have been asking the developers to extend the game's playthrough time, giving them more to do after the credits roll. And thankfully, it seems as though the development team is inclined to listen.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the r/wyldeflowers subreddit, Victoria from the Studio Drydock team commented on another user's comment, confirming that this may change in the game's near future.</p><p>"Wylde Flowers was created and released as a narrative first game — which means when the story ends, that was originally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the game's natural end,</a>" Victoria wrote.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"A lot of people have also shared they want MORE, and to be able to continue playing after the story ends as is, so there will be some additional changes and content coming in the future," she continued. "When our plans and timelines are concrete — we will be able to share more there."</p><p>Victoria also confirmed that when this additional content is added to the game, it'll be free to all players as part of an update and not as a pair DLC.</p><p>While there currently doesn't seem to be a timeline for this extension of the game, it's possible that players will be able to continue to play the game even after the credits roll very soon. Given that the title has only recently been released on both Steam and Nintendo Switch, it's possible these changes will be coming in the near future as the game reaches an even wider audience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMeeqZ5lkaN6prrDZq6ypJSaeqe4zrCcq6s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-mellado-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Mellado - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-tyson-mr-beast-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Chris Tyson Still Married?
