The singer, who was once on the Rivera record label and worked with Jenni's father, Don Pedro, alleges that Jenni's dad stole royalties from her and made her sign sketchy contracts, claims that Jenni outright refuted.</p><p>Before long, there were clips of Graciela calling Jenni "arrogant, selfish, envious, and jealous because I was the girl she always wanted to be" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">circulating</a> all over Spanish-speaking media.</p><p>Things escalated, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Univision</a>, when Jenni dedicated a concert to her <a href=#>ex-husband</a>, who had just recently passed away, and Graciela took issue with her dedication.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Graciela criticized Jenni's decision to dedicate her show to her ex, saying that the singer had previously attacked him, suggesting that dedicating a concert to him was extremely fake on Jenni's part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For her part, Jenni found Graciela's meddling and criticism "heartless" and decided to let loose at a press conference in Mexico City. "We're not at the same level," she cuttingly told the media in Spanish. "And that's not something I'm saying, just ask the radio station managers, ask the businessmen who put on the dances, ask the media."</p><p>One can imagine this public statement of Jenni's only served to escalate tensions, and the beef between these two would go on even after the Diva de la Banda's untimely and unexpected death.</p><p>Graciela then said something about how her music was so good that Jenni practically didn't exist to her, then jumped on Don Francisco's show to defend herself, saying that Jenni was "manipulating [her] words."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>That move prompted Jenni to write a whole narrative song dedicated to her enemy, titled "Los Ovarios," which translates to "Ovaries." Some choice lyrics? "What a fuss you are making about me / How uncomfortable you must be."</p><p>Graciela's response was to criticize Jenni's appearance. "She doesn't like herself, she is obsessed with changing her body," she said on the radio around that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Not even death stopped the beef between Jenni Rivera and Graciela Beltrán.</h2><p>As you can tell, these two had a lot of unresolved issues left to discuss face to face, but Jenni Rivera's untimely death unfortunately stopped that from ever becoming a possibility.</p><p>However, Graciela did take to Twitter to say something to the effect that because she was still alive, she could surpass the success that Jenni had once enjoyed. "NUNCA no existe cuando se habla del futuro. Yo sigo VIVA por lo tanto mi posibilidad de llegar mucho más legos que Ella es mayor," she wrote.</p><p>Jenni's fans were aghast that Graciela would speak so ill of the star, and the fight between these two rivals quickly became a fight between Graciela and Jenni's fans.</p><p>Nonetheless, Graciela claims that her tweets were taken out of context and "misinterpreted," and what's more, that they "don't have anything to do with Jenni Rivera."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjeqi%2BwJygnqSRYq%2BmuNOrmKdlmpq7r7WMq6CvnaKW</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-mason-leave-chicago-fire.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Mason Leave 'Chicago Fire'?
