Yes, this happened in less than two months. All hail Guy Fieri!</p><p>Guy told TMZ that he called up major corporations involved in hospitality and food services, and through his efforts and the efforts of those that work with him, they have awarded more than 40,0000 grants of $500 each to workers who are "facing extraordinary hardship due to the pandemic."</p><p>Restaurant workers can apply for the one-time grant, and others can donate, at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rerf.us</a>. Applications are reviewed by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation (NRAEF), and those who qualify receive the grant money "as soon as possible."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The restaurant industry has had to totally transform in the few short months that the world has been rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic. But Guy believes the industry will survive one way or another.&nbsp;</p><p>Plenty of restaurants are implementing contactless delivery and pickup options, which have allowed them to stay in business and keep some employees on. Obviously, things are different and will be for a while.</p><p>In the meantime, Guy Fieri is making sure restaurant workers get some much-needed support. On Friday, May 8, the NRAEF announced on Instagram that they are sending out 10,000 new award notifications to restaurant workers who have applied for grants.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>While Guy Fieri is spearheading this effort, he is, of course, not doing it all on his own. Several big celebrities and companies have teamed up with him to help raise money for the relief fund.&nbsp;</p><p>Diplo, Dillon Francis, Live Nation, and even Corona, as in the beer, have all helped with the fundraising efforts, and it has made all the difference.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Let’s take this thing to 500k!

That means that tens of thousands of restaurant workers all over the country will soon have a little bit of a financial cushion during this hard time.&nbsp;</p><p>We have no idea when or if things are going to "get back to normal," so it's up to everybody to help support the most vulnerable in our society. Restaurant workers historically have worked very hard for extremely low wages and an unfair reliance on tips. They deserve all the support we can give them.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnMK6ecWinKuhXaeuqr%2FEnWSmp56axm6%2BxKyrmq2ilru1edaoqaSdoqg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victor-bonifaces-grandma-poses-with-ex-arsenal-star-xhaka.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victor Boniface's Grandma Poses With Ex-Arsenal Star Xhaka</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-rick-and-morty-season-5-the-last-season.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fear Not, 'Rick and Morty' Fans: Season 5 (Probably) Won't Be the Last Season</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
