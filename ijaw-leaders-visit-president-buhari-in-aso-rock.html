style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday hosted the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) at the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja.</h2><p>The president during the visit, commended the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) on their recent affirmation of belief in a United Nigeria and supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms.</p><p>The National Executive of INC was led by Professor Benjamin Okaba, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Naija News</strong></a> reports.</p><p>Giving details of the meeting, the president’s spokesperson, <strong>Garba Shehu</strong> noted in a statement that Buhari implored the leadership of the association to use its influence ‘‘in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.’’</p><p>The President also used the occasion to address some demands of the association on several issues including environmental degradation, restructuring, creation of states, allocation of operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people, the inauguration of the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), among others.</p><p>On the Hydrocarbon Remediation Project, President Buhari said he had directed the Federal Ministry of Environment to ensure that the remediation efforts in Ogoni are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.</p><p>Similarly, the President said the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment, is working to ensure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented while all relevant agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.</p><p>Addressing their call for immediate restructuring, the President noted that the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that the constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria has already concluded regional consultations.</p><p>‘‘As soon as they finalize the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part,’’ he said.</p><p>On the creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people, the President said it is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly with concurrence at the state levels.</p><p>On the allocation of operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people, the President said while he completely agrees with the demand, ‘‘the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.’’</p><p>On NDDC, the President pledged that the Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted.</p><p>‘‘A contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succor to the people of the region.</p><p>‘‘Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.</p><p>‘‘I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.</p><p>‘‘However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated,’’ he said.</p><p>The President also assured the leadership of INC that the completion of the East-West Road remains top on his infrastructure agenda, adding that the occasional disturbances by youths in some communities along the route of construction work would require the close attention and guidance of leaders in the region.</p><p>‘‘Furthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge,’’ he said.</p><p>In his remarks, Professor Okaba urged the President to mandate the Ministry of Petroleum Resources to direct the relocation of the headquarters of all oil companies to their operational bases in Ijaw land and the Niger Delta region.</p><p>‘‘The excuse of insecurity is no longer tenable for it is common knowledge that nowhere in Nigeria is safer than the other. Secondly, the revamping of the major ports at Onne, Warri, Port Harcourt, Bonny will accelerate economic growth, reduce joblessness, youth criminality and contribute to national unity and stability,’’ he said.</p><p>Reaffirming strong faith in the ‘‘overall and mutual benefits of true federalism and resource control to the prosperity and stability of Nigeria,’’ Okaba assured the President that the Ijaws ‘‘have no secessionist agenda.’’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FtZqKikax6rbHAnZyrq12rtrS102anq52jnrGmutNmma6gkae2brXNZpisp12nvKS3jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./running-mate-jang-tells-pdp-how-to-solve-lingering-crisis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jang Tells PDP How To Solve Lingering Crisis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./snoop-dogg-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Snoop Dogg Has Four Kids, but Is Only Close With Three of Them</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
