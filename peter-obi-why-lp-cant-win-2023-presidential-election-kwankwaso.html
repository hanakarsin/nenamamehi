The only opportunity now is the NNPP. We are aware that on social media, the young men and women of the Southeast extraction are working towards getting the presidency, but the facts on the ground are that even if the entire zone or any zone in this country decides to vote for a particular person, that person, going by the provision of our constitution can not be president. I think the Constitution is deliberate to ensure that everybody in the country is involved.”</p><p>“Today, many people in the Southeast believe that they are being marginalised and it will even be worst if they are not involved in the 2023 project. Labor Party as it stands today can not certainly win an election because the support is mainly from a particular zone and the figures there can not earn anybody a presidential position,” he said.</p><p>Kwankwaso said he is sympathetic to the agitations in the South East due to alleged marginalisation, adding that his party is bent on picking a vice-presidential candidate from the region.</p><p>The NNPP presidential candidate added that the relationship between his party and the LP would allay the tensions in the region, calling on their leaders to ensure that the alliance work.</p><p>He said, “I have many reasons why I, as Rabiu Kwankwaso is sympathetic to South East and I think the relationship between LP and NNPP will cool down a lot of tension in the South East. We don’t want a situation whereby a particular section of the country will feel that it is being marginalized and already we have a lot of tension there. And this tension is not good for the South East and for the country.</p><p>“We have a situation today in this country where in that part of the country, the whole zone is being shut on Mondays; so many people are being killed and so many business opportunities are being wasted.</p><p>“That is why I take this opportunity to say that the leaders at that level should think positively so that this marriage can work. And If this marriage doesn’t work, the implication is that his own candidate in the PDP will be the biggest beneficiary because the North today, the way they operate politically is not very clear to many people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49tZqmdpJq%2FbrvBomSwoKliubF5wpqlrWWnnrtufo9ramaooprAqrDEp6uimZxisq2xwq2gqKZdoMSiusqwmKynXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ecowas-tinubu-sends-delegation-to-niger-mali-burkina-faso.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tinubu Sends Delegation To Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerian-army-speaks-on-secret-killing-of-6-igbo-soldiers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Army Speaks On Secret Killing Of 6 Igbo Soldiers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
