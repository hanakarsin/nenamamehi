This is sequel to Nnamdi Kanu’s plea to the Court to have him moved to the Kuje Prison from the detention facility of the DSS,” he said.</p><p>“We are aware of the motives of some of his supporters to intimidate and harass judicial and security officers to do their biddings through petitions, propaganda and blackmail so that he could be transferred to the prison which they could easily attack as they have done to many Police Stations and Correctional Facilities in the Southeast, in the last six months,” he added.</p><p>He stated that prominent individuals who are arrested and detained at the DSS facility are normally given superior treatment, compared to what they stand to get at Police cells.</p><p>The officer cited series of attacks on security personnel and their facilities in the South-East by IPOB and ESN where many lives of innocent citizens and properties were lost.</p><p>“For instance in April this year, the police confirmed that IPOB/ESN militias were behind the attack on Imo Prison with sophisticated weapons such as General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), Sub-Machine Guns (SMGs), AK49 rifles, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) after razing the state Police Headquarters with vehicles parked in the premises.</p><p>“Nnamdi Kanu even had the gut to celebrate the destruction when he emphasised via his verified Twitter account that no soul deserves to be locked up in Nigeria’s prison. Imagine him now saying he prefered the same prison facility</p><p>“His lousy, callous and inciting threats were some of the pieces of evidence that our foreign partners considered in justifying the need for his repatriation to face his trial in Nigeria after jumping bail… Meanwhile, Justice Binta Nyako had revoked the bail granted him and also ordered his arrest anywhere in the world which prompted the action we took for his return to Nigeria.</p><p>“Has any country come out to support him or condemn the action we have taken?” the officer asked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BwZqOto6l6qrqMrJycraKewbp5wKCcp5uZmsBuwc2cpq%2BdomK2sbvBrGSppJ%2BperW7jJqrrZmToHqswcmeZKmqmai8r3nFq5yeZZ6jrq6wyGaimqalZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-new-hype-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Hype House Members Have Taken Over the Clout House</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./648574-amazing-nigeria-police-kill-5-armed-robbers-arrest-one-alive-hot-shootout-photo-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Police Kill 5 Robbers, Arrest 1 In Fierce Gun Battle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
