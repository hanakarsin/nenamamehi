Such system even has its own name in books. Their society was acephalous, in other words, Igbo people preferred a system without any centralization. There was no particular hierarchy or leaders.</p><p class=align-left>Igbo people preferred village by village rule as well as direct democracy and strong traditional beliefs of the tribes. All habitants could take part in discussions and help in making the final decision.</p><p class=align-left>As you have understood, the pre-colonial rule in Igboland was focused inside villages. Each village was a ‘mini-state’ and people who lived there formed that old political unit. It was a prototype of democracy with Town Assemblies as their major political institution and Councils of Elders as their main political unit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7bvmcjg5v8t.jpg><h3>Pre colonial political administration in Igboland</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/50625efcb3bbfb65.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>This was the man who developed African writing system which the colonial masters destroyed (photos)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Every village in Igboland had a Council of Elders that carried legislative, executive and judicial powers. It consisted of representatives of every family that lived on that territory. Each representative had its own name in the council, which sounded like ‘Ofo.’</p><p class=align-left>Of all the elders' members, there was a member respected by other the most. Usually, it was the wisest and most senior person who was called ‘Okpara’ and could gather meetings and be the judge if needed. However, he wasn’t treated like a king or Mr. Predisent. His voice wasn’t powerful and couldn’t make decisions without the voices of all the Igbo families in his village.</p><p class=align-left>Let’s look at the political administration scheme of the council of elders:</p><ul><li>Ofo – heads of each family</li><li>Okpara – the eldest representative of the council</li></ul><p class=align-left>The Council of the village was responsible for settling disputes and arguments, punish those people who disobeyed moral and behavior rules, etc. within its territory.

However, none of these groups could perform judicial, executive and legislative functions on their own because these were collegial decisions only.</p><p class=align-left>In old times, Igbo tribes didn’t follow ‘traditional’ forms of government in those centuries, such as Kingdoms and Empires. The Council of elders, groups of people (Ozo, Age grade, and priests) formed the Town Assembly called Oha-na Eze. In other words, everyone from the tribe ruled in their small villages and respected the beliefs and traditions of their ancestors.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt56q43mpdn6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 ways to win elections in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can notice that pre-colonial administration in Igboland reminded of a democratic republic where all the important roles were shared between families in the village.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Origin of Igbo tribe in Nigeria</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKDlGtwbGWgp7Jur86lpqehkaF6orDMoqWiq6SnrrW1zqdkop%2BSpLmiusNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shaun-cassidy-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shaun Cassidy - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thom-brennaman-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Has Thom Brennaman's Wife Responded to His Usage of a Slur on-Air?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
