Why will a former Vice President be behind the plot to sack PDP national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus? What will be his interest?</p><p>“This is someone who has commenced the process of having conversations with stakeholders of the party on reconciliation. A man who has encouraged processes aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the party.</p><p>“The trip he made to Port Harcourt came after a one in Delta. And he has more in the offing. Why will he promote peace and stability in the party and be behind moves to sack Secondus? It’s ridiculous for anyone to talk about this.</p><p>“Atiku understands the Constitution of the PDP and what the party says about tenure for party leadership. So he cannot be working against something that he understands and promotes. That is not how democrats behave. Those are anti-democratic behaviour and that is not who he is. Whoever is saying this, should know that this is a beer parlour talk and unnecessary mischief, ” Mr. Ibe said on Tuesday.</p><p>The statement however added that Atiku understands there are issues within the PDP that must be resolved and that is why he visited Rivers State Governor, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Nyesom Wike</a></strong> recently in Port Harcourt to bring everyone together and move the party forward.</p><p>“The crisis is related, we can not isolate one from the other. He recognizes that there are issues, like in every party administration. When you have more than two persons, people will have different positions. So, the important thing is how to resolve them. And he has commenced the movement to resolve the issues.</p><p>“Atiku is an individual, yes a major stakeholder in the party, and he has taken steps to bring everybody together to see how these issues can be peacefully resolved. They are all related, either the one that happens now or before. They are all part of the larger problem facing the party.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the embattled National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <strong>Prince Uche Secondus</strong> has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>revealed that a strong chieftain of the party</a></strong> is trying to hijack the PDP from him.</p><p>Secondus who spoke on Wednesday alleged further that the person whom he refused to name, is working on denting his image.</p><p>The PDP chairman revealed that the person is pushing for the party to have an interim arrangement in the form of a caretaker committee so he could take over the party structures.</p><p>The alarm raised by Secondus was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Ike Abonyi, titled, ‘Who is after Secondus and why is somebody in love of caretaker?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49tZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmoV2gu7DDjKemraCZo7RurcGorK1loKGur7%2BMraZmqpWivLexjKycnKeemcK0ecWrpqZln5uzqq%2FEZpitoZuqfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pdp-g5-reveal-reason-for-meeting-with-tinubu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>PDP G5 Reveal Reason For Meeting With Tinubu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./june17-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>June 17 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
