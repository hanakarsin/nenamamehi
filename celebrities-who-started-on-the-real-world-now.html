My then-roommate and I decided to drive down for the open auditions. Even if nothing came of it, which it didn't, we would still get to spend a day riding rides. There are no losers in this equation. Due to my rapidly fading memory of my often misspent youth, I recall very little of that adventure.</p><p>What I do remember is my outfit: an ankle length skirt paired with a tank top. If that sounds a little too <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sister Wives</a> adjacent it's because in the late 90s, dressing like a half hippie was all the rage. Had I gotten on the show, who knows where I would have ended up. Perhaps I would have parlayed my time on The Real World into something more interesting, like these former cast members did. Let's take a look at celebrities who started on The Real World.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Karamo Brown</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Since 2018, <a href=#>Karamo Brown</a> has been the beating heart of Netflix's Queer Eye. This reboot of a far less emotional yet still culturally significant reality show has allowed viewers to see a different side of the former Real World cast member. We originally met him on The Real World: Philadelphia in 2004. Nowadays he's using his background in social work and psychotherapy to change the world one conversation at a time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jamie Chung</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's hard to believe Jamie Chung has been in the public eye since her turn on The Real World: San Diego in 2004. Since then, she has snagged a ton of roles on the large and small screen. Many will probably point to her time on <a href=#>Dexter: New Blood</a>, but we couldn't get enough of her version of live-action Mulan in ABC's Once Upon a Time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Miz</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The Miz is a bit of a legend in the Real World Cinematic Universe. We first met him on 2001's The Real: Back to New York. From there he branched out to Real World/Road Rules Challenge, Battle of the Seasons, and Inferno II. Perhaps those experiences helped prep him for his current gig as a professional wrestler in the WWE. He has also dabbled in some non-wrestling television but we will always love to see him in the ring.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cameran Eubanks</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It seems as if Cameran Eubanks's celebrity is bi-coastal. From The Real: World San Diego to six seasons of Bravo's <a href=#>Southern Charm</a>, is there anything she can't do? Oh, she also wrote a collection of essays titled: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Day You'll Thank Me: Essays on Dating, Motherhood, and Everything in Between</a>. We can't say for sure if any juicy Real World stories made the cut, but we've got our fingers crossed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mike Manning</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It doesn't surprise us to learn that Mike Manning burst onto the reality television scene via The Real World: DC, and is now a soap opera actor. If there's one skill you hone on an almost daily basis in Washington, DC it's acting. His time as Caleb McKinnon on The Bay earned Mike a Daytime Emmy Award. He is also a successful producer and activist, which also makes sense for DC.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jacinda Barrett</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When The Real World went international in 1995, they landed across the pond in merry ol' England where Jacinda Barrett joined the cast of The Real World: London. The Australian-born model quickly landed film and television roles once the show ended. She has certainly done a lot since then but for our money, her most forgettable role is as Bridget Jones's made-up rival in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLKtscGroK2hlah6uLTOZqqtmaKpsqV5zqdkraCVYr%2BmrctmrqiqnJl6r7vW</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bua-transcorp-gtco-others-join-as-investors-lose-e2-82-a678-7bn-at-stock-market.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BUA, Transcorp, GTCO, Others Join As Investors Lose 78.7bn At Stock Market</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./subway-bodak-yellow.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Subway Commuters Come Together For A 'Bodack Yellow' Dance Party</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
