The president reviewed their performances and decided to remove them because he wanted to consolidate for legacy performance,” he said.</p><p>Based on the review carried out, Adesina noted that there was room for improvement and Buhari wanted to reinvigorate his cabinet for the last stretch of his tenure in office.</p><p>He added that the loopholes observed had to be filled, hence the decision to relieve two Ministers of their duties and replace them with others.</p><p>“The largest room in the world is the room of self-improvement. If you check, the ministers’ sectors were affected. We can always improve in whatever we do, but the president must achieve what he wants to achieve in the 20 months left. Maybe that was why he removed them, but that was by no means a red card,” he said.</p><p>Adesina added that Buhari reserves the right to hire and fire those that work with him as nobody is entitled to any position forever or too big to be removed.</p><p>“Only the president can determine how these people will be selected. This is to show that national service is for God and the country. So you leave gladly when it is time to go. It is not a chieftaincy title,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sacked minister of power, <strong>Saleh Mamman</strong> has reportedly <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>collapsed in Abuja</a></strong> and landed at the hospital shortly after he was removed from office on Wednesday.</p><p>Mamman who was appointed as minister of power in 2019 was sacked by President Buhari alongside the minister of agric, Sabo Nanono.</p><p>A family source that spoke with The Gazette under anonymity said, “he collapsed yesterday and was immediately hospitalized.”</p><p>“He wasn’t expecting to be fired so soon.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49rZputmJa%2FqnnDqJyspqRixKK602arqGWWnruqv8dmmKxlkWK5sL%2FEq2SfnZ2eeqKwxKygp5ldqLWmsNJmpKiqlWK5qrPHrWSopl2stbp506GcZqiimsCqsMSnq2arkZi4prCMra6oZZ2eu6q%2F056prGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./menna-fadali-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Menna Fadali - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-apollo-and-phaedra-parks-friends-rhoa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are Apollo Nida and Phaedra Parks From RHOA Friends?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
