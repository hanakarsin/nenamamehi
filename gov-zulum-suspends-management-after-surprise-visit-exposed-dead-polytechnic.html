Nothing is working. The workshops are not in existence, the mechanical workshop is not working, the agricultural workshop is not working, like-wise the entrepreneurship centre is not working.</p><p>“The School is facing myriads of problems, ranging from lack of funding and commitment. As former student of this polytechnic, a former rector, I have moral stakes in this polytechnic. Insha’Allah, I will not allow this polytechnic to rot during my era as Governor of Borno State. I will do everything possible within my reach to ensure functionality of this institution insha Allah.</p><p>“I have directed the Commissioner of Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation to take over the affairs for the next six months. The ministry is to ensure that all the Workshops and the laboratories are put back to use as soon as possible.</p><p>“The entrepreneurship centre should immediately be put back to use as well. When I was at the Polytechnic as rector, the entrepreneurship centre was producing nothing less than 10,000 to 20,000 school desks and chairs every month. We produced hospital beddings,” Zulum said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FqZqCnpmLHtrjUpmSsraOlsq%2Bw0makmqaRnLKusc2tZJqepJq%2Fbr%2FUq6eroaOaere10qKrZp2opby0scNmm56ZlGK9sLjYrZycoJ6esHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./427177-man-publicly-supports-fathers-decision-remarry-a-year-mothers-death-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Man Publicly Supports Fathers Decision to Remarry a Year after Mothers Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./buhari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Buhari On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
