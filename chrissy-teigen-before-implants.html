The model announced that she had taken a coronavirus test in preparation for surgery to remove the implants she’d had put in during her work as a model. Chrissy’s explanation came after she shared a video of herself taking a test for COVID-19, which led fans to wonder whether she was sick or worried about having the virus.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Chrissy Teigen look like before her implants?</h2><p>As she made the announcement that she would be having her implants removed, <a href=#>Chrissy</a> posted a photo of herself from the days before she had them put it. In the post, her nipples are covered with a pair of stars. “I’m getting my boobs out!," she wrote in the caption to the post. “They’ve been great to me for many years but I’m just over it.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Hi hi! So I posted myself getting a covid test on the twitter, as I’m getting surgery soon. A lot of people are understandably curious (and nosey!) so I’ll just say it here: I’m getting my boobs out! They’ve been great to me for many years but I’m just over it. I’d like to be able to zip a dress in my size, lay on my belly with pure comfort! No biggie! So don’t worry about me! All good. I’ll still have boobs, they’ll just be pure fat. Which is all a tit is in the first place. A dumb, miraculous bag of fat. ❤️</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>chrissy teigen</a> (@chrissyteigen) on May 26, 2020 at 3:55pm PDT</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>"I’d like to be able to zip a dress in my size, lay on my belly with pure comfort!

A dumb, miraculous bag of fat. ❤️" Chrissy has been discussing having the implants removed for a while, but now, it seems she’s going through with it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chrissy had the implants put in when she was 20.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour UK </a>in March, Chrissy said that she’d gotten the implants for swimsuit shoots. “It was more for a swimsuit thing,” she explained. "I thought, if I’m going to be posing, laid on my back, I want them to be perky! But then you have babies and they fill up with milk and deflate and now I am screwed." Even in that interview, she admitted she was no longer happy with them.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had a quarter ‘teardrop’ cup in the bottom and filled out the breast line. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I want them out now</a>,” the model said. “If I could do one thing, it would be to have a lift." Chrissy made her debut as a model in 2010 issue of The Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition. In her interview with Glamour, Chrissy said that she had been hesitant to undergo plastic surgery because of her kids.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I think you’re supposed to replace [implants] every 10 years," she said. "But when you have kids, you think about [the risks] of surgery and I think, 'This is not the way I want to die, in boob surgery.'" Now, it seems Chrissy has decided that the pros of getting the surgery outweigh the potential risks it poses.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chrissy also shared a video of her coronavirus test.</h2><p>When fans began criticizing her for getting the test, which was part of her clearance for surgery, she had a response ready to go. “Everyone in LA&nbsp;can get tested for free. I’m having surgery and had to. I’m sorry if this offends you," <a href=#>Chrissy</a> wrote. At that time, she didn’t offer any additional details about what surgery she was getting, but now we know.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdKssGaslZ60prqMm5yfp6Kaeqq5z6WYp6yj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./transfer-updates-doherty-onana-maguire-lukaku-and-others.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Doherty, Onana, Maguire, Lukaku, And Others</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./borrowing-for-recurrent-expenditure-foolish-obasanjo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Borrowing For Recurrent Expenditure Foolish</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
