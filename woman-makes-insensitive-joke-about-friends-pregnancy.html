One woman took to Reddit's infamous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AITA community</a> to share how a joke she made about her <a href=#>friend’s pregnancy</a> really backfired. She shares her side of the story and why she thought her friend would find the joke funny, but Reddit had zero sympathy for her.</p><p>How bad could the joke have been? Well, it touches on an already controversial issue in the U.S. — <a href=#>abortion</a>. Not to mention this friend had been trying for a baby for years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Woman makes cruel joke about abortion to her pregnant friend.</h2><p>In a post titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“AITA for making a joke when my friend told me she was pregnant?”</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">u/Suspicious-Hair8165</a> told us all about her insensitive joke that seemingly led to the demise of a friendship.</p><p>She refers to her friend as Alice, who is 32 years old. The OP, who is 29 years old, writes that Alice and her husband had been trying for a baby for three years.</p><p>The OP notes that she doesn’t have any children. It’s unclear if she never wants children or if she just wants them later in life.</p><p>That aside, she shares a few details about her friendship with Alice. She says they previously would joke about how things would change if Alice became a mom while OP remained childless.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>AITA for making a joke when my friend told me she was pregnant?</a><br>by <a href=#>u/Suspicious-Hair8165</a> in <a href=#>AmItheAsshole</a></figure><p>Alice told OP that she’ll miss all the disposable income and compared OP’s dog to a human kid. “Neither of us got offended with this joking and it was all in good fun.”</p><p>But then Alice got pregnant.</p><p>While out to lunch with OP, and a few of their other friends, Alice broke the news that she was three months pregnant.</p><p>OP writes: I jokingly said, “I’m so sorry. Let me know if you need a ride to the clinic.” Alice flipped out and called me an insensitive b----. I told her that I was joking but she wouldn’t hear it and she ended up leaving. She hasn’t responded to my texts and calls ever since."</p><p>OP writes that their other friends at the lunch are staying out of it.</p><p>She continues: "I understand that my comment would come off as rude if I said it to a stranger, but Alice knows me and this is how we joke with each other. AITA?”</p><p>Well, OP asked and Reddit answered. Every response told OP she was wrong.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Users told her she wasn't a good friend and chided her for not being able to stay serious when her friend shared an exciting life update. Overall, most users didn't approve of the joke.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>"This joke was insensitive considering she may be petrified about miscarrying after trying for so long," wrote one Redditor, urging OP to apologize to her friend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit</span></figure><p>Another user explained how maybe a joke along the lines of "well there goes your vacation in Paris" could be forgiven, but a joke about taking her to an abortion clinic was "tasteless."</p><p>The user also added: "I could make a 'joke' about you saving money on a shower gift since you have probably lost a friend, but that would be rude too."</p><p>The Reddit post has since been locked "due to an excess of rule violations" as it appears that people in the comment section got too heated in their responses.</p><p>That said, we hope the OP got the message loud and clear that she went overboard with her joke and can now work on trying to make right by Alice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mpJqjlah6qrrSnqWsoaSew6Z5yaiinmWRl7y2wIyfqaKdnpnAbrzRnp6nmZ6Yxg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./yakubu-is-the-problem-with-nigerias-electoral-process-you-must-boycott-inec-elections-onovo-tells-opposition.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Yakubu Is The Problem With Nigeria's Electoral Process, You Must Boycott INEC Elections</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./just-in-ondo-gov-akeredolu-loses-mother.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ondo Gov, Akeredolu Loses Mother</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
