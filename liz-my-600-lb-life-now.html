The Texas native — who was bedridden for more than a decade and suffered from lymphedema on her legs — shed a staggering 353 pounds. But, losing nearly half her body weight was no easy task.</p><p>During Liz’s episode, she revealed that she had gone through emotional trauma as a child. “I was born with an abnormity in my leg. The bone was curved, which resulted in one leg being shorter than the other. I couldn’t be as active as I would have liked to be,” she told cameras. &nbsp;</p><p>Though she had a “happy childhood,” Liz revealed that she was molested at the age of 6 by someone her family knew. Scared to tell her parents about the attack because she felt “ashamed,” she kept it hidden. As she got older, the TLC star revealed that her father developed a drug addiction. By the age of 10, Liz confessed that she started using food as an outlet for her pain. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Liz decides to make a change in her life.</h2><p>The TLC star contacted<a href=#> Dr. Younan Nowzaradan, aka Dr. Now</a>, who admitted her to the hospital in Houston to help the 700-pound woman start shedding weight to undergo gastric bypass and lymphedema surgery.</p><p>Though she was losing weight after the strict diet Dr. Now place her on, Liz needed to be able to stand to get the lymphedema surgery. “It's been really hard on me. They have been doing exercises with me, but I haven't been able to stand just yet,” she said about her ongoing physical therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have been able to start to sit up and get to the edge of the bed, which I feel is good progress because that has been more than I have been able to do in a long time.” After many ups and downs during her one year stint in the hospital, Liz was finally able to get the surgery on her leg. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>“I have been able to start to sit up and get to the edge of the bed, which I feel is good progress because that has been more than I have been able to do in a long time,” she said.

When she went home, she gained nearly 50 pounds back from bingeing on fast food and pizza. After being admitted to the hospital again to be monitored, she dropped those pounds and underwent the bypass surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>TLC updated fans at the end of the episode, sharing that Liz now sees a therapist and was finally able to take a few steps with the help of an aid. On an update episode of My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now?, &nbsp;it was revealed that "old fears are about to threaten her progress" on her weight loss journey.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Since it appears Liz is not on social media (or her accounts are set to private), we’re keeping our fingers crossed that Liz is still dedicated to her physical and mental health!</p><p>Catch new episodes of My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now?
