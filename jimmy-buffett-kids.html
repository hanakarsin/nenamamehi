He had two daughters: Sarah Delaney Buffett and Savannah Buffett. He also has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">adopted son</a> named Cameron Marley Buffett.</p><p>The child who is in the spotlight the most among the three is Savannah. She used to have a radio show on <a href=#>Sirius XM</a> called Savannah Daydream' Radio Hour, which is no longer on air. Now, she lives a calm life and calls herself a "lifestylist."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Savannah Buffett (@getsavvy)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>"For me, being a ‘lifestylist' means helping people to enjoy life – whether it is via music, fashion, athletics, travel, or hosting a party. It's all about finding ways to expand someone's horizons," she wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her official website</a>.</p><p>Savannah also has over 13,000 followers on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram account</a>, but she does not post consistently.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Jimmy Buffett married at the time of his death?

The couple got married back in 1977, but did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">part ways temporarily before getting back together</a> in the '80s.</p><p>She is the mother of both of his daughters.</p><p>Before Jane, Jimmy was briefly married to a woman named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Margie Washichek</a> from 1969, until their divorce in 1973. There is not a lot of public information about her.

In fact, he released a single titled "Live, Like It's Your Last Day" back in 2020 that acknowledged his life motto.</p><p>"When you’ve had a couple of close calls — an airplane crash, a stage dive — you think you’re probably living on borrowed time. So I kind of do choose to live like it’s my last day. You never know. At 73, you’re losing a lot of friends, and it’s a constant progression towards … y’know, what’s there. Everybody goes at some point," he now cryptically told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a> in 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the announcement of his death on Instagram, it was shared that Jimmy "lived life like a song till the very last breath."</p><p>Now, it's up to fans to carry on his legacy by enjoying his iconic music. And of course, the star's carefree spirit will continue to live on forever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auudhmma6elprBtXnKopus</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karthik-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karthik - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anas-rashid-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anas Rashid - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
