In August 2018, the family said in a statement, Kody and his large brood were ready for a new adventure in the Grand Canyon State.&nbsp;And, since 2020, Kody, his wives, and his more than a dozen children among them have been living somewhere they figured would be a little more accepting of their lifestyle.</p><p>“As much as we’ve loved making our home and memories here in Las Vegas, we are excited to embark on a new adventure in Flagstaff, Arizona,” the statement said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. “We are looking forward to cooler temperatures, the mountain air, scenic views, and the slower lifestyle of Flagstaff.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did the 'Sister Wives' stars move from Las Vegas?</h2><p>The move was documented in Season 13 of the reality show. After calling Las Vegas home for more than seven years, the move was a bittersweet time for the Browns.</p><p>"Vegas has been good for us; I’m not saying that it hasn’t, it’s been really good. And it’s been great for our kids. They’ve all really grown here and done so many wonderful things and it’s been great for us," Christine said at the time. "I’m just ready for the next adventure."</p><p>Unfortunately, though, Meri's initial move to Flagstaff hit a bit of a bump in the road. In the Jan. 12, 2020 episode of Sister Wives, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meri was forced to move</a> all of her belongings from her rental home in Flagstaff, Arizona, into a new place. Evidently, the landlady ended up getting flak about Meri from her neighbors, who weren't happy about her plural lifestyle. It's for this reason Meri temporarily moved back to Las Vegas until a more permanent living situation could be arranged in Flagstaff.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mixed feelings/emotions about staying in Vegas for 3 months while I found another house in Flagstaff. I LOVE Vegas (no secret) but it was hard being away from the family. I traveled back and forth often those months!<a href=#>#SisterWives</a></p>— Meri Brown (@MeriBrown1) <a href=#>January 6, 2020</a> <span>Source: Meri Brown/Twitter</span></figure><p>Though they came to love Sin City, the decision to make Las Vegas their home wasn't an easy one for the extended Brown family.&nbsp;The first time we saw the Browns move, they made the jump to Las Vegas from their native Utah, where they were being persecuted for their polygamist lifestyle.</p><p>Though Kody can only be legally married to one wife at a time (he was legally married to his first wife, Meri, from 1990 until 2014, when he legally divorced her so that he could legally marry his most recent wife, Robyn), he’s spiritually married to all four of his wives, making it technically legal despite laws in Utah saying it’s a felony to marry or cohabitate with more than one person.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The COVID-19 pandemic hasn't been easy on Kody Brown's wives.</h2><p>As if the dynamic in the relationship wasn't difficult enough for Kody and his wives, the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 made things even more complicated. Ahead of the Season 15 premiere, Janelle Brown was shown in the clip from the season feeling hopeless in the marriage since she hadn't been able to see her husband much during the pandemic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by SISTER WIVES | TLC (@sisterwivestlc)</a></p></figure><p>Because all of Kody's wives live in different homes in Arizona, he has always had to divide his time and attention between them. But COVID-19 made matters worse in terms of remaining safe and, it seems, it will be a high point of tension in the Brown family. Their move to Arizona was one &nbsp;that suited their family's needs, but it might not have been enough to save all of Kody's relationships.</p><p>Fortunately, the Browns were safe from any persecution once they settled in Arizona; while one local article from 2008 said that the state’s rules on polygamy are "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fuzzy</a>" at best, there are only laws banning bigamy, which is legally defined as marrying a second person. Unlike Utah, there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no laws against cohabitation in Arizona</a>, meaning Kody and his wives were legally sound for their new life among the mountains.</p><p>Watch Sister Wives on Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecCrnGarmajBpr6MsKCvnaNiuaat1aKloGWclsBuwsSgmKw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wike-is-planning-to-use-this-to-silence-the-opposition-cole-blows-hot-defies-executive-order-21.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wike Is Planning To Use This To Silence The Opposition</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./northern-elders-back-endsars-make-fresh-demand.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Northern Elders Back #EndSARS, Make Fresh Demand</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
