I do not speak for the Police but it is certain that no Nigerian or anyone for that matter is in the SSS/DSS custody on the order(s) of private citizens or persons.”</p><p>“The SSS has an SOP on the criminal justice administration.”</p><p>“The media owes a duty, propelled by good conscience and common good, to guide public narratives about some government agencies and their sacrifices to uphold security, peace and unity of this nation, Nigeria. The SSS should not be run down given the slightest opportunity.”</p><p>“You had been at the commanding heights of governance and national security administration and management to understand issues so as not to misinform the public. It is unacceptable for a respectable columnist of your experience and status to make a sweeping statement like the one herein.”</p><p>“It is misleading, inciting, denigrating, demeaning, misinforming and should be withdrawn. The SSS and indeed security agencies, if not praised, should be supported. The Organisation may not be perfect but it is doing so much for the Country. It respects and loves the citizens and residents and strives to serve them based on best practices, rule of law/engagement and a balance between rights and national security.”</p><p>“Thank you Sir as you correct this erroneous impression created about the Service. I remain your partner in progress and service to fatherland.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Federal Government has explained <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>why it stopped negotiations</a></strong> with bandits and Boko Haram insurgents over the abduction of students.</p><p>Speaking with reporters on Wednesday after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, said the bandits and insurgents used funds raised from ransoms to re-arm themselves.</p><p>Nwajiuba asserted that paying bandits and Boko Haram insurgents will give them the opportunity to buy arms and ammunition, thereby escalating insecurity in the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e49uZqysn6V6rcXIp55mmZeWtq%2B%2F02asrGWUqMBuw8Crpaxln6HCtLHGrqVmmZSau6rFyGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wolfgang-pauli-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wolfgang Pauli - Trivia, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./intrigues-as-bola-tinubus-running-mate-revealed-hours-before-inec-deadline-ganduje-masari-el-rufai-left-hanging.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Intrigues As Bola Tinubu's Running Mate Revealed Hours Before INEC Deadline, Ganduje, Masari, El-Ruf</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
