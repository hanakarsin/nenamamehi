(According to ET, Craig worked in real estate in California’s San Fernando Valley.)</p><p>“I still don’t know what took him to the edge, because at that stage he had said to me that he had never met a woman that he felt that way about,” she said at the time. “He was bringing her to meet me [for] his birthday in August. He had decorated his apartment, that I bought him years ago. He had gotten a new job with a prominent real estate company in California, [which] he was very happy with.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Entertainment Tonight/YouTube</span></figure><p>Tina continued: “I have no idea what pulled him down, except something that followed him with loneliness.

The last few times we talked, the conversations were different, and I didn’t know that until after the suicide.”</p><p>The “What’s Love Got to Do with It” singer also reflected on Craig’s death in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a June 2019 CBS News interview</u></a>. “I think Craig was lonely, that’s what I think really got him more than anything else,” she said. “I have pictures all around of him smiling, and I think I’m sensing that he’s in a good place. I really do.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tina Turner (@tinaturner)</a></p></figure><p>Nearly five years after Craig passed away, Tina followed.
