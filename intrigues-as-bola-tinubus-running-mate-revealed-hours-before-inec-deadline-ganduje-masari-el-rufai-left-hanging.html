Tinubu did that just to fulfill INEC’s requirement pending when he makes up his mind on his running mate.”</p><p>Another source told This Day that the running mate selected by Tinubu will hold the position for a few weeks.</p><p>“The name of the running mate submitted would be changed for another northern politician in the next few weeks. The one submitted is just holding the ticket in trust for another candidate to be picked by Tinubu and the party in the next few weeks.</p><p>“The candidate is still widely consulting, because the issues around the choice of running mate are many and he is yet to address them all. So, he is still asking for more time to look into it all – whether he is running a Muslim-Muslim or a Muslim-Christian ticket.</p><p>“He personally thinks there’s a need for more consultation and that’s what he is doing. The debate on the choice of deputy has assumed a level that is currently greater than the party and the candidate, hence the need for comprehensive consultation, which is what he is doing,” a reliable party source hinted last night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5BvZqKmpKe2qMHErGSaq12XvK2tjK2gp62SqsBuvtSnpaKml2K6osDEZqmerpWWuaawjKGmrqqjYq%2Bmss6rnGahnpqwbrDEmpuloZ6aeqitzZ2so51doq60rdGiZJ6kXafCp63IZqOenqRitaK6xqKloGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stop-lying-against-us-dss-warns-olusegun-adeniyi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stop Lying Against Us - DSS Warns Olusegun Adeniyi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./283715-different-styles-write-letters-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Different styles used to write letters</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
