Here's why you don't need to stress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Adult Swim</span></figure><p>It's a good day for <a href=#>Ricky and Morty</a> fans. <a href=#>Season 5 of the show</a> premiered on June 20, 2021, only a year after Season 4 ended (normally it takes one-and-a-half or two years to get a new season). Since we're getting up there with the amount of seasons, you might be wondering if this is the last one for Rick and Morty. As popular as the show is, all good things have a shelf life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Rick and Morty' Season 5 the last season?</h2><p>Rick and Morty Season 5 is very likely not the show's last season. Back in 2018, it was reported that Rick and Morty got renewed for an addition 70 episodes — so that means the show has 50 more episodes to go after Season 5 (and since its seasons generally have around 10 episodes a pop, we're talking five more seasons).</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Adult Swim/YouTube</span></figure><p>While this doesn't mean the show can't end after Season 5, there have been no official announcements from the network, producers, or cast involved about an ending. And that's generally a good sign. No news is good news. We can expect Rick and Morty to continue past Season 5 until someone important says otherwise. Show creator Dan Harmon also confirmed that there isn't a (planned) end in sight. A thousand years&nbsp;Rick and Morty!</p><p>Dan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reminds Paste Magazine</a> that he'll eventually have to retire. When asked what he was looking forward to in terms of Rick and Morty's future, Dan joked, “I mean retirement is a big goal for me. That makes it sound like I don’t enjoy my work. I’m just getting old and I don’t enjoy the audience as much as I used to." He did say he was excited about “working with new writers, and watching old writers be cultivated."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Adult Swim</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What can you expect from Season 5 of 'Rick and Morty'?</h2><p>The cast has been pretty secretive about Season 5, but people who have access to screeners confirm the new season will be as wild and weird as ever. Season 5 introduces Rick's nemesis who apparently humps the air non-stop and forces himself into the family's life in hilarious ways. Morty also finally asks his crush (Jessica) out. In terms of episodes, there will be 10 whole episodes to watch.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where can you watch 'Rick and Morty'?</h2><p>If you want to watch Rick and Morty live, then you need Adult Swim, which is part of Cartoon Network. So, if you have traditional cable, you're probably all set. But if you need other access points to Rick and Morty, you also have some options. First, you can stream the show from Adult Swim's website and the Adult Swim app (you still need access to a cable username and password). You can also access the show using YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, and Sling TV.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Adult Swim</span></figure><p>While it's trickier getting your hands on new episodes, you can always stream the first four seasons on Hulu and HBO Max.</p><p>Watch new episodes of Rick and Morty every Sunday at 11 p.m. EST on Cartoon Network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvsicomaZnpl6rrvRrbBmq5WWwLC6jG5kraCVYrmiv9Nmqp6Zo6S7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./guy-fieri-raised-money-restaurant-workers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Guy Fieri Has Raised $20 Million So Far to Support Restaurant Workers During the Pandemic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./swagg-dinero-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Swagg Dinero - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
