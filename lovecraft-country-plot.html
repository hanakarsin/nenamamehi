But his latest production, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lovecraft Country,</a> looks seriously bone-chilling. The new HBO series, which was written by Underground writer, Misha Green, combines historical fiction with horror-fantasy, making for an extra spooky thrill.</p><p>The plot of Lovecraft Country looks truly enthralling, so if you're looking to get seriously spooked, stay tuned for everything you need to know about the upcoming series and mentally prepare to sleep with the hallway light on tonight.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is 'Lovecraft Country' about?</h2><p>The Lovecraft Country trailer brings viewers back to 1950s Jim Crow America, honing in on the harrowing journey of a young black man named Attitcus (played by Jonathan Majors), who is on the hunt for his father (played by Michael K. Williams). Atticus' father disappeared a while back in New England, which his family calls Lovecraft Country, and he and his beloved road trip companion (played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell) venture out there from Chicago, encountering various horrors along the way.</p><p>Atticus and Letitia face a slew of hair-raising adversities during their long-winded journey, from segregation to bad cops, and a host of fantastical monsters. The story seamlessly weaves theme racism into the fantasy-horror genre, making it a one-of-a-kind production. Check out the full trailer below.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is 'Lovecraft Country' based on a true story?</h2><p>While Lovecraft Country entwines several real-life historical events into the plot, Atticus' wild adventures never actually happened. However, the series is based on a 2016 horror novel of the same name, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">written by critically acclaimed novelist, Matt Ruff</a>. While we haven't seen the show, we're hoping it lives up to the popular novel, which currently boasts 4.5 stars on Amazon.</p><p>Since the highly anticipated production doesn't premiere on HBO until August, we strongly suggest reading the book beforehand — it definitely sounds like a one-of-a-kind beach read.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Lovecraft Country' has an incredible cast.</h2><p>Jonathan Majors stars in Lovecraft Country playing the lead role of Atticus, and there's a chance you've seen his face before. After graduating from Yale School of Acting, Jonathan went on to make his first on-screen debut in the ABC mini-series, When We Rise, and was later cast in The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Captive State, Gully, and Jungleland.</p><p>Jonathan's co-star, Jurnee Smollet-Bell, is also probably a familiar face for many viewers — Jurnee is known for playing Jess Merriweather in Friday Night Lights, as well as her roles in The Great Debaters, Eve's Bayou, True Blood, and Birds of Prey. Needless to say, the casting decisions for the series definitely won't disappoint.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Although Lovecraft Country would undeniably up our quarantine binge-watching game right now, we're seriously excited to see the new thriller series in its entirety come August. And while we are definitely looking forward to it, we're also still recovering from the trailer... TBH, we're terrified already.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3scKrmJ%2BsXZi8trrTq7BmqJykwQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./husband-doesnt-clean-bathroom.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Internet Thinks Woman Should Divorce Husband Because He Didn't Notice She Cleaned the Bathroom</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./245826-sababu-10-za-kuchekesha-za-raila-kujiondoa-kwenye-mjadala-wa-urais-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sababu 10 za kuchekesha za Raila kujiondoa kwenye mjadala wa urais</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
