Although gymnastics and soccer are well-known sports for the big event, surfers also have a chance to win gold. One athlete named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John "John John" Florence</a> is finally an Olympian and is considered one of the most famous surfers in the world.</p><p>Luckily, John has some serious support in his corner thanks to his significant other — but who is she? He does keep a lot of his personal life to himself, but it turns out they have been together for a while now. And she's got a successful career in her own right. Here's what we know about her.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is John John Florence's girlfriend? She's actually his wife.</h2><p>John is in a relationship with an Australian model named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauryn Cribb</a>; the couple live together in Hawaii. She's signed to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Honolulu City Club</a>, and her Instagram features her work with different brands.</p><p>Lauryn and John quietly got engaged sometime around 2019, it seems. In an interview that year with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stab magazine</a>, John said that they didn't post anything about the engagement on social media, but all of their friends and family knew that the couple — who had "been together for a long time now," he said — got engaged.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>John even said he didn't really plan how he was going to purpose. "I woke up one day and I was like, okay today’s the day, but I didn’t have a ring," he told the mag. He went to his mom and she gave him a diamond ring she found on a beach. He said he proposed with that ring as a "placeholder" that would work at the moment.</p><p>John was able to convince Lauryn to go to the beach with him that day, despite her having other plans. After some time avoiding getting into the water despite being nervous, sweaty, and getting sunburnt, he asked her to marry him. Of course, she said yes. John doesn't say when they got engaged, but the interview was published in November 2019.</p><p>And as it turns out, as of a May 2021 article in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yachting World</a>, they "recently" got married.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Laurence (@lauryncribb)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are John John and Lauryn going to have kids?</h2><p>In the Stab interview, John didn't directly confirm that he and Lauryn plan to have kids, but he did give an idea of their future together. The interviewer mentioned that Lauryn might want to be close to her family when they choose to start their own, which means that John might have to make a move to Australia. But he seems up for the move.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Laurence (@lauryncribb)</a></p></figure><p>"I hope I get an Australian passport," John said, making a joke about becoming "half" Australian. Luckily for the couple, this shouldn't be a problem. Both the U.S. and Australia allow people to have dual citizenship, so obtaining passports from both countries shouldn't be an issue. This means that they can do the same for their future kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ypuoyjpqGmXZu5sL7Ep5qeZZeev62y0aKcp5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./arsenal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Arsenal On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brooks-laich-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brooks Laich - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
