Instead, it's about a murder case that was allegedly involved Bigfoot as the culprit. And at the center of the three-episode docuseries is investigative journalist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>David Holthouse</u></a>.</p><p>He's shown in the docuseries as someone who looked deep into the case of three Northern California murder victims who died on a cannabis farm in the '90s. But before Sasquatch, David was already a journalist who <a href=#><u>researched other topics</u></a> and made other documentaries about his findings.

And when he wrote a story for the Denver weekly magazine Westword about being sexually assaulted as a child, it became an NPR story and later a play called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stalking the Bogeyman</a>.</p><p>But besides sharing the hardest parts of his life with the world as he worked through the pain, David has written other memorable pieces that involved him digging deep into a case, a story, or a culture unknown to him.</p><p>For one story, he went undercover as a skinhead to write about a group of Denver neo-Nazis. He also wrote about a three-day bender with meth addicts. He's not afraid to dive into his work in a very raw way.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We're up early!</p><p>Stream our latest series SASQUATCH right now on <a href=#>@hulu</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rOidUSrX5Z</a></p>— Mark Duplass (@MarkDuplass) <a href=#>April 20, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David Holthouse was a journalist for years before he started working on documentaries.</h2><p>David has worked on documentaries and docuseries like Netflix's Night Stalker: Hunt for a Serial Killer about Richard Ramirez, and Amazon's Lorena, about Lorena Bobbitt. And because he was so close to a mysterious case that happened to involve Bigfoot, he was essentially the inspiration for the story explored in Sasquatch.</p><p>In fact, director Joshua Rofé contacted him when he wanted to make a documentary or docuseries about a subject that there wasn't a ton of source material for.</p><p>He explained in a Hulu <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>South by Southwest interview</u></a> that David told him about the murder mystery allegedly involving Bigfoot. It happened near a cannabis farm, where he had spent some time in the '90s while he was working as a reporter. So, while David has always sought out stories, apparently, he has kept some of the juicy ones closest to his chest over the years.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">David Holthouse's private life is kept mostly out of the spotlight.</h2><p>While David has been open about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>his childhood trauma</u></a> with the media over the course of his decades-long career, there are other aspects about his life that not many people are familiar with.
