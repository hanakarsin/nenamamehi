From low-base pays, to <a href=#>customers who don't tip</a>, to rush hours that tear you every which way every second of your shift, it can be a truly high-stress situation.</p><p>So it doesn't come as a surprise that there are a number of servers who hop onto social media to air out their grievances with their vocation and don't shy away from calling out customers who make their jobs more difficult than they need to be.</p><p>And while there are tons of examples of some pretty lame and downright rude customers floating around the internet, sometimes servers drop the ball, leaving paying diners left to twiddle their thumbs at their tables for longer than they would like.</p><p>This is what TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@daeslb</a> said happened to them while dining out at an establishment in Baltimore, Md. The wait was so long, that they even phoned the restaurant from their table in order to get a waiter or waitress send their way.</p><p>In a clip that was uploaded to the popular social media platform, a woman can be seen seated at a table in the restaurant, talking on the phone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@daeslb href=#>@daeslb</a><p><a title=edrbaltimore href=#>#edrbaltimore</a> wasnt too much relaxing ðŸ˜­ service was trash but iâ€™ll back , not with a large party though <a title=sundayfunday href=#>#sundayfunday</a> <a title=edrbrunch href=#>#edrbrunch</a> <a title=edrbaltimore href=#>#edrbaltimore</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - Pretti'Ole Lanee'" href=#>â™¬ original sound - Pretti'Ole Lanee'</a></figure><p>A text overlay in the video says that the service was so "trash" at the place that the customer resorted to calling the front desk while seated at the eatery in order to get a server sent to their table.</p><p>"They forgot we was sitting outside. We sitting at the table we have our server we've been sitting here for thirty minutes," she can be heard saying on the phone.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daeslb</span></figure><p>Someone else can be heard off camera saying, "And brunch over at five and we paid for bottomless Mimosa. They wiped it down and all of that." as the woman on the phone continues to speak.</p><p>A caption for the clip provides further context on the incident, and it seems like even though the TikToker didn't really have the best time there, she says that she would be back: "wasn't too much relaxing service was trash but i'll back, not with a large party though"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daeslb</span></figure><p>One commenter who saw the clip couldn't understand why the party would continue to stay there if they weren't being served: "Nah, I would have left. They must not want my money lol," they wrote.</p><p>Someone else said that they visited the same restaurant in the area and that they too had a negative experience: "mannnnn i went on sunday..they didnâ€™t have bottomless mimosas, ran out of pancakes, my eggs was hard and we was tryna pay for 45 minutes. HORRIBLE!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daeslb</span></figure><p>Another viewer just couldn't believe the diners had to resort to calling the restaurant after they had been seated just to be acknowledged by the wait staff after 30 minutes: "Damn the fact that she had to call is crazy smh"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daeslb</span></figure><p>Someone else also confirmed that they too had to wait an inordinate amount of time to receive their food when dining at the restaurant: "Went for my birthday last year. Food was delicious but we had to wait over an hour for food."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daeslb</span></figure><p>Have you ever visited a restaurant where you had to call up the main line in order to get a server at your table? Would you continue to stay if it got to that point? Or do you think that dining and dashing at that point would be justified?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmMK0wM6mnKtlk5a5rb%2BMq5ysrJGqv6K602arqGWXmsFuv8SrrZ6qXam8bsDHnqCrZaSWr62x</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ederson-moraes-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ederson Moraes - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-the-black-wookiee-bounty-hunter-book-of-boba-fett.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is the Black Wookiee Bounty Hunter in 'The Book of Boba Fett'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
