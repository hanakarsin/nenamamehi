The kooky cast is both lovable and detestable, and they are never short of drama. From lovers to fighters and <a href=#>back to lovers</a>, we tune in every week to see how their dynamics play out.</p><p>Although <a href=#>the original Jersey Shore</a> ended in 2012, there have been plenty of spinoffs since. From Snooki & Jwoww to the now-running <a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a>, there isn't a shortage of our favorite reality stars. But what are their zodiac signs?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jenni "JWoww" Farley — Pisces</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>JWoww was born on Feb. 27, 1986, just a couple of days short of being a leap-year baby! This makes her a Pisces, which makes sense considering her amicability and compassion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi — Sagittarius</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Our girl, Snooki, is a Sagittarius, which isn't a surprise. She has all of the creative energy and outgoing nature of a Sagittarius, and she's loyal to the ones she cares about with a fiery passion. Her birthday is Nov. 23, 1987. Also, like a stereotypical Sagittarius, Snooki never holds her tongue.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Paul "DJ Pauly D" DelVecchio — Cancer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Pauly D is always there for a good time. His birthday is July 5, 1980, which means that he's a Cancer. Notoriously emotional and moody, the high emotional threshold (both a positive and a negative at times) of a Cancer fits perfectly with Pauly's up-and-down personality.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Vinny Guadagnino — (Scorpio)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Vinny's birthday is Nov. 11, 1987, which makes him a Scorpio. Scorpio males are known for their deceptive and tumultuous personalities, especially when it comes to romance, but once they're in your corner, they are with you for life. This fits well with Vinny, who is the sweetheart of the house ... unless you're on his bad side. He has trouble trusting new people, but he stays close to his bestie, Pauly D.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Deena Nicole Cortese — Capricorn</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Deena wasn't part of the OG Jersey Shore cast, but she is definitely part of the family. This Capricorn cutie is one of the most responsible in the cast and has had a consistent relationship with her husband, Chris Buckner. Born on Jan. 12, 1987, Deena is always prepared to keep her fellow castmates in check.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Samantha "Sammi Sweetheart" Giancola — Pisces</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>We all love Sammi, and to this day, there's no Jersey Shore moment more iconic than the "anonymous" letter written to her about Ronnie's infidelity. Their rollercoaster romance has been the center of the show, and it's no surprise it was so emotional with Sammi as a Pisces and Ronnie as a Sagittarius. The water and fire signs often find each other in toxic relationships, but luckily, Sammi found her heart with Justin May. Born on March 14, 1987, she is a Pisces.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ronnie Ortiz-Magro — Sagittarius</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>We all thought Sammi and Ronnie were end-game, but Ronnie's problematic relationships throughout Jersey Shore proved that impossible. After his on-again-off-again relationship with Sammi, he dated and had a daughter with Jen Harley, although they then accused each other of physical abuse.</p><p>Ronnie has since attended a treatment facility for alcohol and depression and is now dating Saffire Matos. His birthday is Dec. 4, 1987, making him a Sagittarius — notoriously passionate and funny, two of his definite traits.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino — Cancer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Mike "The Situation" is fittingly a Cancer, considering his various emotional feuds from his past. But he's left his tumultuous past behind because if there's anything we know about Cancers, it's that they love to nest. Mike was born on July 2, 1982.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Angelina Pivarnick — Cancer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Like Pauly D and the Situation, Angelina is also a Cancer, which shines through in her insecurities and her loyalty. While it took her some time to trust her fellow castmates, she eventually settled into the family. Her birthday is June 26, 1986.</p><p>There are plenty of other cast members and significant others who have joined the Jersey Shore: Family Vacation cast since the show's initial run, and we haven't forgotten about them!</p><ul><li>Lauren Sorrentino — Capricorn</li><li>Jen Harley — Scorpio</li><li>Christopher Buckner — Pisces</li><li>Christopher Larangeira — Cancer</li><li>Zack Clayton Carpinello — Sagittarius</li><li>Nikki Hall — Aries</li><li>Saffire Matos — Virgo</li><li>Vinny Tortorella — Scorpio</li></ul><p>New episodes of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation air every Thursday at 8 p.m. EST on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7Kzv8SyZKygn6eybq%2FArKtmsp%2BZtqKvjKygoKaj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adams-oshiomole-fixes-date-to-declare-presidential-ambition.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adams Oshiomole Fixes Date To Declare Presidential Ambition</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-party-members-dump-apc-pdp-for-nnpp-in-gombe-state.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Party Members Dump APC, PDP For NNPP In Gombe State</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
