The game was developed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ember Lab</a>, an indie studio comprised of only 14 people who went viral thanks to their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan animation</a> of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.</p><p>According to co-lead developer Josh Grier, creating a video game after the team's surge in popularity was "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the natural next step</a>" for them after their video.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The game was formally announced in June 2020 during the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation 5's official hardware unveiling</a>. While originally being developed as a console-exclusive title for the PlayStation 4, the team eventually received the tools to develop the game for the PlayStation 5 as well, according to an interview with the developers for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Informer</a>.</p><p>After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">numerous delays</a>, including one caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Kena was finally released on September 21, 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Kena: Bridge of Spirits' an open-world game? Not really!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The story follows the eponymous Kena, a young spirit guide on a quest across a forest wasteland in search of a sacred shrine in the mountains. Along the way, she communicates with the lingering ghosts of the deceased.</p><p>Throughout the game, she interacts with all sorts of spirits and tries to help them move onto the afterlife, while also meeting living inhabitants who help her on her journey. The spirits that she meets can become corrupted and must be dealt with through combat.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Players control Kena in this third-person action-adventure title. Throughout the game, she uses her magical staff and various weapons to fend off enemies and explore her surroundings. She can also collect spirit companions called "the Rot," an expandable group of critters that can help complete tasks or even distract foes.</p><p>As your faithful and adorable companions, the Rot can even be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">outfitted with new clothes</a> such as hats.</p><p>Kena's journey, however, is not exactly open-world. The game is played from a third-person perspective and features a hub world in-between explorable jungle-like areas. While there is a degree of free-roaming and traversal throughout this vast adventure, the world itself doesn't feature the wide, explorable spaces that are found in other games like <a href=#>Breath of the Wild</a>.</p><p>Like any good next-gen game, however, Kena also features a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo mode</a> that lets players take detailed pictures of Kena's world.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The game is playable on multiple platforms and is currently available on PlayStation 4 and Playstation 5, and also available on PC through the Epic Games Store. The PlayStation 5 version uses the DualSense controller's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">haptic feedback</a>, which simulates the physical feel of various in-game actions such as Kena using her Spirit Bow.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are critics saying about 'Kena?'</h2><p>The game was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">showcased</a> at the 2021 Tribeca Film Festival through an hour-long playable demo, which received positive reviews.</p><p>The game itself garnered good reception. Metacritic calculated an average critical score of 81/100, indicating "generally favorable" reviews. Many critics praised its deep combat, level of exploration, and high-end graphics and visuals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBut8SnmGaaop6xqLGMqJ1mq6Cev6rA0mamqZ2eYsSwvsud</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./795063-buharis-govt-greatest-danger-ex-presidential-candidate-warn-nigerians-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Buhari's government is very deceitful Onovo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bbnaija-reunion-your-girlfriend-fine-pass-me-beatrice-angrily-drags-boma-for-shaming-her-figure.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BBNaija Reunion: Your Girlfriend Fine Pass Me?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
