After a successful hometown date with Ashley R. in Orlando, Fla., the Oklahoma native was on cloud nine. Things were off to a solid start for him on his quest to figure out which of his <a href=#>remaining two ladies</a> he wanted to be with.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, before his second hometown date with Ashley L. in Dallas, Texas, Landon learned heartbreaking news about his father that jeopardized his future on the series. He explained on the show that he had to head home early. Here’s what happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Landon’s dad on ‘Farmer Wants a Wife’?</h2><p>Ahead of Landon’s hometown date with Ashley L. in Dallas, the rural reality star received devastating information that halted his journey on the show. Instead of being in Texas with one of his remaining women, Landon appeared on-camera at his Oklahoma farm with tears in his eyes. He explained that he had no choice but to put a hold on his search for love.</p><p>“My dad had (some) health concerns here lately,” the Farmer Wants a Wife star revealed. “And [I] found out he didn’t make it through.” The news of his father’s passing made Landon reevaluate his participation in the reality series, with the leading man saying, “Times like these put everything into perspective for you.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The cattle rancher continued to explain that while he couldn’t be with his father at the time of his death, his mother was by his side the entire time. “My mom was sitting there with my dad at the end,” Landon said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“My family and I have got to be there for each other right now. Everything on the side pales [compared to] what we’re all going through. I don’t know. It’s just a lot right now.”</p><p>With that, the Oklahoma native decided to leave Farmer Wants a Wife and be with his family when they needed him most.</p><p>After Landon revealed that he was leaving Farmer Wants a Wife, the reality star took to <a href=#>TikTok</a> to honor his dad. The cattle rancher shared a video compilation featuring countless photos of his father, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">writing</a>, “We can’t pick our dads. But if I could, I’d pick him every time.”</p><p>According to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obituary</a> that appears to be Landon's dad's, he passed away in November 2022. However, no other details were given.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Landon still pick someone on ‘Farmer Wants a Wife’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While Landon didn’t state whether he intends to return to Farmer Wants a Wife, several signs indicate that a reappearance is unlikely.</p><p>The preview for the May 10 episode did not feature Landon or any of the farmer’s remaining women, meaning their journeys were cut short in light of the tragic news.</p><p>However, even if the Farmer Wants a Wife star does not return to the series, that doesn’t mean he won’t pick someone. Given the strength of Landon’s connections, he could have reconnected with one of his flames after the show.</p><p>Episodes of Farmer Wants a Wife air Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Fox. You can also stream new episodes the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSlmZ6ZvK95w5qbZp6Rp7qmvoywmKeso2KubsPIn5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./liz-my-600-lb-life-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'My 600-lb Life' Star Liz Evans' Old Habits Threaten Her Weight Loss Journey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./374891-onja-historia-ya-vigdis-finnbogadottir-mwanamke-wa-kwanza-kuchaguliwa-kuwa-rais-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Utamu wa historia: Vigds Finnbogadttir, mwanamke wa kwanza duniani kuchaguliwa kuwa Rais</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./70354-html.html>Another Blast In Kano, 3 Dead</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./405730-dci-yamkamata-mjakazi-aliyenaswa-kwenye-video-akiwadhulumu-watoto-wa-mwajiri-wake-html.html>DCI yamkamata mjakazi aliyenaswa kwenye video akiwadhulumu watoto wa mwajiri wake</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ty-burrell-html.html>Ty Burrell - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./yung-berg-html.html>Yung Berg - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-atiku-to-declare-presidential-ambition-anytime-soon.html>'Atiku To Declare Presidential Ambition Anytime Soon'</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
