Someone actually named their kid "Tu Morrow" which seems like they're just destining the child to become a lifelong procrastinator. Another person blessed their child with the moniker "Seven," but at least it wasn't spelled the same way as David Fincher's crime masterpiece.</p><p>And who could forget the <a href=#>infamous baby name Elon Musk gave to one of his kids</a>?</p><p>But a TikToker recently got into a conversation on uncommon baby names when she declared how sad she was that the ride she named her child after was shutting down.</p><p>Which prompted a lot of questions from other users on the platform.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@vegangranolamom href=#>@vegangranolamom</a><p>ü•∫ <a title=disneyworld href=#>#disneyworld</a> <a title=disney href=#>#disney</a> <a title=disneybaby href=#>#disneybaby</a> <a title=momsoftiktok href=#>#momsoftiktok</a> <a title=splashmountain href=#>#splashmountain</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Aidan Smith" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Aidan Smith</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @vegangranolamom</span></figure><p>A TikToker by the name of Kara who posts under the handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@vergangranolamom</a> posted a clip of her holding her baby with a text overlay that reads: "The ride I named my daughter after shut down today at Disney I'm so sad."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @vegangranolamom</span></figure><p>Other users on the platform immediately started joking about the situation, while some truly wanted to know what she could've possibly named her child.

Not Breyer, but like the Briar Patch. And I got her name because I was looking at a baby name list on Pinterest when I was pregnant and I saw the name Briar and I never heard of it but I really love natur-ey names and it reminded me of the little Briar Patch on the Splash Mountain ride."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @vegangranolamom</span></figure><p>She added, "We do love Disney so I was like that's such a cute name.
